		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ted,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
nice article and a good overview about baselines.&lt;br /&gt;
I also recognized another of your blog posts (/index.php/DataMgmt/DBAdmin/sql-server-baseline-creation) and in the comments you´ve mentioned a SSIS solution. I´m looking forward to it once it´s available @ codeplex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regards&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Good point, Grant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I keep baselines forever and build on them but base everything on a 13 month rotation.  The 13 months is because you have to consider year-end.  The month after a fiscal year ends will be a heavy reporting time and that time in the baseline is critical to knowing how to deal with it (or more so, prepare).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baseline information should be collected all the time so you have the evolving view of how everything works.  You review the activity for a week, month and year then to know your baseline activity during those times.  Each business and how they use data is completely different as well (in most cases).  Week 26 in a fiscal run may be hard hit while company two has a week 5 that is a killer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You have to have that evolving information to know this.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next question someone will ask is, &quot;How is that different from real-time monitoring?&quot;  It&#039;s a lot different in the retention time you would keep for active monitoring for one.  You don&#039;t keep a year of SQL Monitor data. At least I don&#039;t.  The stats that you monitor there are heavier and it adds up faster.  Real-time monitoring is for reactive troubleshooting.  Baselines are for proactive troubleshooting and for use in your reactive troubleshooting of real-time.  Meaning, using your baseline in the event real-time monitoring has problems as another piece of information to troubleshoot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice article. But it didn&#039;t give one piece of information that is constantly asked, how far back do you maintain a baseline? A year, six months, 1 month?]]></description>
