		<description><![CDATA[The difference in memory management from 2000 days to now is great and a vast improvement.  You should always set the max memory setting allowing memory to windows though.  I&#039;ll check the BOL article out.  It sounds like maybe it is worded to possibly think it is stating not to do this.  If windows starts reporting memory shortages, performance is going to suffer while memory starts being &quot;trimmed&quot; to account for it.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BOL has some issues in some articles.  If that page is saying you don&#039;t need to set the maximum memory allocated or SQL Server; it is one that has an issue ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Setting maximum memory has long been common advise. However, recently a more experienced DBA has made me reconsider. For a dedicated DB server, SQL Server is supposed to perform better without a maximum limit. BOL suggests to only set this if the server will be used with other software and to not set it if it is dedicated:&lt;br /&gt;
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181453.aspx&lt;br /&gt;
I am told that older versions of SQL Server were not very good at allocating memory intelligently--which is probably why it is so well-known--but that this has improved much in the newer versions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would be interested in a more up-to-date discussion on the merits and need for this in recent versions.]]></description>
