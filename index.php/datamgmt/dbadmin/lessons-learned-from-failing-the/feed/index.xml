		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a SQL server dba with 4 years of experience.  I took the exam back in November and failed (662 :( ).. I had a very hard time with questions relating to SQL profiler, data warehouse, and database mirroring. I don&#039;t normally use those bits of SQL server in my day to day job.  I aced the sections pertaining to backup/restores, replication, and instance installation. I&#039;ve been trying to study up on those bits of the test I had a big problem with. Taking the exam later today. Feeling much more confident than the first time around. You&#039;ll do great next time!]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
I also know from your tweets and blog posts that you know a lot about SQL Server and that you love to learn. In my book, you&#039;re succeeding by a ton of measures. I am really looking forward to seeing you present in the future, too.]]></description>
