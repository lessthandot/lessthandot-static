		<description><![CDATA[I agree, understanding the business you are on (and who and how you do business with others) can help you provide more effective reports, applications, and communications with the same or less effort. Understanding the needs of the people we work with and being able to communicate can drastically reduce delivery time of solutions as well as long term maintenance (not to mention the benefits they receive from having a tool or report that better fits their needs, sooner).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That same understanding helps us provide opportunities to the business. We are hired for our knowledge and skills and it is nice when we can take advantage of that to offer options that wouldn&#039;t normally occur to someone without those skills or experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good article (and topic) :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll second (or third, as the case may be) this motion.  I had typically been accustomed to understanding enough of the business to be able to understand what was being asked for and then able to interpret the request well enough to design the functionality that the business actually needed.  Until recently, I assumed this was the standard.  Sadly, I have found that I am the exception to this.  I wish that more developers had this ability as it would simplify things a great deal and create greater efficiencies and less cost from having to redo applications because of the communication breakdown.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article.  I think it is critically important for every employee of a company to at least understand the basics of what the company offers.  It&#039;s too much to expect everyone to be an expert in all areas of the business, but the basic understanding immediately increases the value of that employee.  I wish all employees shared your perspectives.]]></description>
