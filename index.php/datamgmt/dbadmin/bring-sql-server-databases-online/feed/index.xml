		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, you can.  I haven&#039;t tried it with this instance.  Working on getting it done.  Another huge issue is getting forcibly disconnected a lot.  Which is making data integrity fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s SSIS bulk load when avail.  trimmed to 32670 (IIRC) to a packet size so I don&#039;t plug the hole.  I have a blog coming.  There isn&#039;t much detail other than the point that you really need to consider these issues when you are doing a conversion to a cloud solution.  Azure at least.  I have RDS access now and I&#039;m going to test it out next week at night when I have time. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you bcp into Azure from a local instance?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example with Amazon RDS you can do the following&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
bcp store.dbo.customers in C:SOmeHugeDataFile.txt -n -S rds.SomeName.us-east-1.rds.amazon.com,4080 -U admin -P insecure -b 10000&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are you using SSIS fast load, how are you loading the data?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m writing up my load to Azure.  I wonder if we can set something up with the volume I&#039;m pushing and have a comparison.  This was the first chance I&#039;ve had to really load a huge amount of data to Azure and I&#039;m really disappointing.  Tuning the packets, multi-stream...everything was done right.  :(]]></description>
