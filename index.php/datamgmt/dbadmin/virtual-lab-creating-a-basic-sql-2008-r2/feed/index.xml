		<description><![CDATA[Sure. I was actually intending to make a wiki entry to act as an index and provide links to that and back, but I was procrastinating until I had another post or two. I&#039;ll go ahead and add the link and then start the wiki this weekend (there is an outside possibility that I will have 2 posts for next week anyway).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll go back through the links and figure out which ones I missed the target on, add it to my personal backlog. :P&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the DC one is next and it&#039;s already been split into two parts so it wouldn&#039;t be longer than this one :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Geez, this was loong! Good job! (Eli, not a biggie but can you set up the links such that they open in another window? It&#039;s kinda a pain to have to click the Back button just to get back to your article. Doing an &quot;open in new tab&quot; is a pain too. And yeah, whining is easy.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway--I like this! The virtual machine setup is what&#039;s most helpful to me. I&#039;ll give it a try in the next two weeks and thank you again after.;) Any particular reason you installed the 32-bit version of R2?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I really, really, REALLY will be waiting for this post: &quot;creation of a Domain Controller and Domain&quot;. Thanks.]]></description>
