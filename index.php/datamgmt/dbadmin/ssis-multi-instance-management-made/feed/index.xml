		<description><![CDATA[This is only to make management and uploading of SSIS packages easier for the DBA who is responsible for managing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you create any connections like a SQL job for instance, it will still have to reference the server where the msdb is located instead of the server where you added the XML entries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One way to view this XML configuration is to see it as a &quot;central Management Server&quot; for SSIS packages, just a central point of management.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have mine seet up this way but how do I use the expression for my connection manager to know which databases to hit.  With one instance as the default only I can check the server name and know to connect to that server but with multi instances on a server I don&#039;t know which one to execute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I have DEV and UAT as instances I will have the same package on both instances and I don&#039;t want to have to recode the package as it moves up the tier from DEV to UAT and want the package to figure out which tier it is on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great tip!  It also still frustrating that the services are not cluster aware.  Easy to say it isn&#039;t needed since the services don&#039;t really have a functional impact on &quot;uptime&quot; but a nuisance nonetheless.  It is just another thing that is an extra step in HA that probably doesn&#039;t need to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
