		<description><![CDATA[when executing this command on the subscriber - 

CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_128
ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE TDECert;
GO
ALTER DATABASE DBA
SET ENCRYPTION ON;
GO

I get - 
Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
Cannot find the certificate &#039;TDECert&#039;, because it does not exist or you do not have permission.
Msg 5011, Level 14, State 5, Line 1

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I have copied both files from the publisher into the \data directory on the subscriber.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I run this command on the subscriber it completes successfully. 

CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION
BY PASSWORD = &#039;Password$1&#039;
GO
CREATE CERTIFICATE TDECert 
FROM FILE = &#039;TDECert&#039;
WITH PRIVATE KEY 
(
    FILE = &#039;TDECertFile&#039;,
    DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = &#039;Password$1&#039;
);
GO


However when I run the next statement. 

CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_128
ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE TDECert;
GO
ALTER DATABASE DBA
SET ENCRYPTION ON;
GO

I get the error below. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thx Phil
