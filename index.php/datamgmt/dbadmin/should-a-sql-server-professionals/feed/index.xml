		<description><![CDATA[My first client server project was an Access (version 1.1) front end to a Sybase (version 4.9.x) back end. &lt;br /&gt;
We had really primitive Sybase tools - we bought a tool called  SQL Programmer (or SQL Miner or something - memory fails me) from a Canadian company to ease the pain of working with just a SQL command window.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I learned Sybase coding (Triggers, Stored Procedures, etc) from a Belgian who had never previously taught the class in English. Those were the days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each database server you learn makes you more valuable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The converse is true as well. Oracle/Sybase/MySQL (don&#039;t forget this freebie as well) professionals should &quot;cross train&quot; as well. I&#039;ve been in multi-platform shops off and on since 2001. Another factor to consider is platform consolidation. In a multi-platform environment invariably some XO will decide that supporting them has a negative TCO and very well consider eliminating one of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget FoxPro.  I know you love you some FoxPro :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks, Jeff.  I&#039;m going to bring it down tonight at home.  Probably going to change the direction of the next post to that.  Seems much more useful!]]></description>
