		<description><![CDATA[I think there is one major techie &quot;role model&quot; on TV, Penelope Garcia, on Criminal Minds. Unfortunately, that&#039;s a show not many girls are probably watching. It&#039;s definitely an adult show. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whenever I see Penelope work her magic on her plethora of computers, screens, and access to any information she wants, I think about how cool it would be to have her job!!! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
LOVE the comment on wanting to be treated fairly. My Mom, who was one of the few women in IT 30 or so years ago, struggled with being treated fairly for a long time. For her, I think it was motivation to work even harder and prove that women are awesome too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;d like to think in this day and age, women ARE treated more fairly, but if that were the case, there wouldn&#039;t necessarily be a need for WIT groups... Good for you and all the other participants in WIT striving towards getting kids involved/interested in technology, science, engineering and math!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The comment regarding lawyer shows in the 80&#039;s and the corresponding increase in law school applicants is interesting. Correlating to today, the only mainstream &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;tech&quot; show I can think of (bearing in mind that I don&#039;t watch a lot of tv to begin with) is The Big Bang Theory - and the main characters in that show are guys with the lead female being a non-nerdy actress. Perhaps changes in Hollywood by breaking down that stereotype might help...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And remember &quot;I hate chess&quot;...(sorry Allen)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What works for you won&#039;t necessarily work to inspire others, start with what makes you passionate, but look for what the people you&#039;re trying to influence are passionate about, and try to find them ways to explore that interest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought the discussion about &quot;courageous&quot; was interesting, and could be inspiring, but thought your point was more compelling; that it was up to the other boys in that group to allow the girl to not *have* to be courageous. There is as much or more work that needs to be done to teach young boys not to discourage girls (accidentally even, as with the example of the group named &quot;the Gear Guys&quot;) as there is to encourage young women to enter IT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Great session!]]></description>
