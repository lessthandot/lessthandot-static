		<description><![CDATA[Great piece of information. I&#039;m an accidental DBA. Our logs were growing like crazy, 6MB database had 6GB log file size. I was trying to shrink the log file but it was not getting shrunk. The recovery model was FULL. The &#039;log_reuse_wait_desc&#039; said &#039;LOG BACKUP&#039;. I set up hourly transaction log backup and nightly full backup of the database. But still I was not able to shrink the file. I used SSMS and took a log back up, I didn&#039;t see the options quite closely. I accepted the defaults. But after reading your blog, I wanted to verify the options too - and the default for transaction log was &quot;Truncate the transaction log&quot;. This is for SQL Server 2012. According to your article, you have stated no log file after the truncate only option can be used for point in time recovery. Does this change after the next nightly full backup?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Amanda,  Thanks and glad it helped.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adjusting the intervals in backing the trans log up will be your best bet here.  :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The log itself should not be a stress point.  Look to the reasons it is being beat up (if you will) from how things are hitting it.  Sometimes you uncover some strange things that are being done that simply require a small change through the proper channels and you are off to the races with it all]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article. I really enjoyed reading it. We recently have been having problems with our transaction logs growing to big for our resources and I was toying with the idea of truncating but I am glad I read your article first...not really sure what to do yet though. I am trying to limit the stress on the database server as it has a lot of things hitting it already (code, customers using our software, and of course people directly accessing it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s not nitpicking at all.  It was a complaint I received often and have been working on with peer reviews prior to publishing.  I will review older blogs like this one and make corrections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the comment and suggestions.  They all help greatly in my efforts to share what I know on SQL Server.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to nitpick at free (and helpful) information here, but can you work on the grammar?  Especially your constant use of the word &#039;rate&#039; instead of &#039;right&#039;.  It&#039;s hard to focus on the content when you have to keep re-reading the sentences to figure out what you&#039;re trying to say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes I did the compression post and is shows a nice improvement in backup time as well as restore time and of course the backup itself is only about 25% of the original uncompressed one....And going forward standard editions will also be able to create a compressed backup not just do the restore]]></description>
