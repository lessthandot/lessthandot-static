&lt;br /&gt;
I haven&#039;t tried Foglight yet but do want to at some point.  The reason I&#039;m starting off with posts about DM is because of the amount of time I&#039;ve spent with it and the benefits from it that I&#039;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the really nice things with DM is the new Instance Dashboard (v7.0+).  You have almost everything you need one screen to get a good feel of how your server is really performing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We tested Idera DM in our company, but decided to go with Quest Foglight instead. Idera is very useful, but the granularity of customization in Foglight convinced the executives. Custom dashboards are built for all our critical systems, which monitors from the DMZ to the DB end to end what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But these commercial monitoring tools are just like the different flavours of database engines, they all server specific purposes and some, scale better information-wise, for large enterprises. I am yet to see what value System Centre 2012 deliver since they consolidated the entire SCCM Suite into one product, which is essentially now *free*.]]></description>
