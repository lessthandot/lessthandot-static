		<description><![CDATA[Koen, great post.  I&#039;ve hit this as well.  A couple other things to be aware of.  When you do the repair or upgrade you may lose customizations you have made within the MDS database.  I had created a custom view, extending the base subscription view for an entity, the upgrade deleted this view.  This is noted in the small print in the MDS on line documentation.  Also if you have business rules you should validate the model after the upgrade.  The upgrade appears to invalidate entity members.]]></description>
