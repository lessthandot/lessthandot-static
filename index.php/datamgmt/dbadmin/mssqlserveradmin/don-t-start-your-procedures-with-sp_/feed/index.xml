		<description><![CDATA[Hi George

Please check this statement in your blog.
&quot;When SQL Server executes a stored procedure, it first checks to see if it is a built-in stored procedure (system supplied). It checks the master database for the existence of this procedure. If the procedure is not found, it will search the user database.&quot;

Well in reality,it doesn&#039;t check the master database,it only checks the user database. If you expand in SSMS under the user databases,in system procedures folder you will get all the procedures which area exact copy of the system stored procedures in the master database. 

You can check for yourself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Irina the problem with a name like this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
mnyAnnualSalary&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
is that when 2 years later you decide to change the datatype to decimal(16,4) most people don&#039;t change the column name since it might break all kind of code so now the mny doesn&#039;t make sense anymore&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
these days with syntax coloring and intellisense nobody should name their columns or tables like that anymore&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even in .NET Hungarian Notation is not recommended anymore for objects]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Irina,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no REAL problem with using hungarian notation for your column names.  No problems as far as the database is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The problem occurs when humans are expected to write code for the table.  If you look at the column names Denis used, they are all self explanatory regarding the data type.  There&#039;s an ID (int), a couple names (strings), a BirthDate (DateTime), AnnualSalary (Money).  Using a 3 letter prefix on your names does not really help anything, and actually makes the code harder to read.]]></description>
