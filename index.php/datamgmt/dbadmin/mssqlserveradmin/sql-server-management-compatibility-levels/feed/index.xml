The side-by-side comparison of two modes is really useful when you&#039;re trying to decide how painful an upgrade is going to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The other false assumption I have seen is that by setting the compatibility level lower, new functionality will not work. People think they can develop in a 2012 instance for a 2005 database and the lower compatibility level will make sure it will work. Wrong. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You should not develop in a database that is a higher level than your production database. Even if that means your developers are cranky because they have to work with older stuff. If you do, you are almost guaranteed to have surprises where things don&#039;t work when pushed to prod. Sometimes really bad surprises.]]></description>
