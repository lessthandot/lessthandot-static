		<description><![CDATA[Hi Vinnie. Thanks for the compliments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. AWTest is a subset of AdventureWorks that I quickly imported into PowerPivot for a quick test. Country Analysis is a dataset I pulled together myself by using Data Explorer. You can read more about it here: /index.php/DataMgmt/business-intelligence-1/how-i-used-data-explorer. The Olympics Analysis is a PowerPivot workbook I downloaded. I forgot the URL, but something similar can be found here: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/tutorial-import-data-into-excel-2013-and-create-a-data-model-HA104073811.aspx.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. A single farm config like this one is great for a demo environment or for training purposes (I didn&#039;t really implement a secure environment here). It could also be used as a development environment. However, it is not secure and not scalable at all.&lt;br /&gt;
If you want a reliable scalable environment, you need to go with the multi farm config. I&#039;m no SharePoint expert, so I didn&#039;t go with this set-up in the blog series. It wasn&#039;t needed anyway, because I just wanted it to run on my laptop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Verbeeck. This has been a very beneficial series for a beginner like myself. I was able to implement this environment after a few evenings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A couple questions. 1) where did the data sources from above come from? the AW Test, CountryAnalysis Olympic etc? I didn&#039;t see a place to download them and don&#039;t think its part of the default instillation. 2) considering real world applications, what are the pros &#038; cons of single farm cofigs like this and multi farms configs (which is mostly what I hear about)?]]></description>
