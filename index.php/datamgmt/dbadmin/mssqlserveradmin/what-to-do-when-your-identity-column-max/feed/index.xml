&lt;br /&gt;
This will only work, if the application is able to handle negative IDs. Mine probably won&#039;t. :-(&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Denis. I should update my article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was proceeding on the assumption that the numbers should proceed away from 0 (1 to 2147483647, -1 to -2147483648). But your solution is to just set the identity value to the bottom of the range and proceed toward 0. Clever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you got where I was going with it.  Many times over I&#039;ve seen the references and also seen FK&#039;s not removed correctly in large databases and some ERP systems.  I step very lightly when it comes to identity seeds and reusing skipped values.  I&#039;ve seen the value used in order numbers, po numbers, confirmation numbers and on which can cause issues even if the delete was done right and then you reuse the value.  Creating the possibility for issues in reporting and internally other things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m a chicken when it comes to a design I wasn&#039;t part of.  There&#039;s always something in the DB you may have not come across.  &lt;br /&gt;

I like you&#039;re idea on signing though.  development would be interesting but it&#039;s very good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[onpnt,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could see reusing gaps in special situations, especially because the identity seed of a column persists through rollbacks. The presence of FKs would mean that it is safe to use the gaps, as long as your database doesn&#039;t have historical references to the old, deleted values (the huge assumption here).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider the following code:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DBCC CHECKIDENT(MyTable)&lt;br /&gt;
BEGIN TRAN&lt;br /&gt;
GO&lt;br /&gt;
INSERT MyTable DEFAULT VALUES&lt;br /&gt;
GO 10000&lt;br /&gt;
ROLLBACK TRAN&lt;br /&gt;
DBCC CHECKIDENT(MyTable)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#039;ll see that the identity value of the table has increased by 10000--a real waste if you have some process in your production environment that racked up a bunch of these before you managed to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#039;re right that there are a lot of assumptions in software that this solution could interfere with. That&#039;s why we always try to follow best practices even when they seem more theoretical than practical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, the artificial key value of an identity column should always be treated as &lt;strong&gt;meaningless&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes never relying on it as proof of order-of-insertion or age (examples of allowing meaning to creep in). Code should be written in such a way that all your identity values could be shuffled around every day (and of course their corresponding foreign keys updated in accordance) and the application would still function smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suppose it would also be good to ensure that the application uses &lt;strong&gt;signed&lt;/strong&gt; integers to match what SQL server is doing, or to ensure that a 1-1 bit-level mapping exists in your data access layer between the unsigned ints in the application and the signed ints in SQL Server.]]></description>
