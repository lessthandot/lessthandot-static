		<description><![CDATA[And don&#039;t forget blogging as a good form of improvement :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I read about 100 blog posts a month on a variety of technical and non-technical topics, blog (less frequently recently), and try to always have a project I am working on. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another great resource is the many conferences and user groups that now record their sessions and put them up for free. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/channels/oredev&quot; title=&quot;Oredev videos on Vimeo&quot;&gt;Oredev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd&quot; title=&quot;TechEd videos on Channel9&quot;&gt;Teched&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlpass.org/LearningCenter/SessionRecordings.aspx&quot; title=&quot;PASS videos&quot;&gt;PASS recordings (login req&#039;d)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blip.tv/oreilly-velocity-conference&quot; title=&quot;Velocity Conference videos&quot;&gt;Velocity Conference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/mobilism&quot; title=&quot;Mobilism conference videos&quot;&gt;Mobilism conference&lt;/a&gt;, ... I haven&#039;t even gotten to any user groups yet and that&#039;s probably weeks worth of content.]]></description>
