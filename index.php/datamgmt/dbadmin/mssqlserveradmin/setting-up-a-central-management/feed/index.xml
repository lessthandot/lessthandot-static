		<description><![CDATA[I updated the article with that security group (I had no idea it existed!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still like to list instances which will require SQL Authenication and not save the password.  The reason is so that I still have a complete list of all my SQL Instances.  I also wouldn&#039;t  recommend saving the password because it won&#039;t be very security that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two built in roles provided for CMS, which are ServerGroupAdministratorRole as well as ServerGroupreaderRole which is a safer option to assign to developers (referencing your scenario).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, it is not really &quot;possible&quot; to use SQL authentication with CMS as it does not save credentials, whenever you connect to any server saved in CMS, your Windows Authenticated Credentials will be used.]]></description>
