		<description><![CDATA[Hi Brent, Backups are the #1 way I would deal with most of those types of scenarios.  I think most of us would.  Coming from hardened SOX audited list of companies, I&#039;ve learned they love static representation of the data at a point in time.  Backups will be the quick and stable way to give that to them.  I hope I didn&#039;t come across in the post as in saying backups can be done away with.  That is impossible in a complete recovery model. Object deletion I&#039;ve been playing with LiteSpeed and the object level recovery which I&#039;m sure you&#039;re familiar with ;).  Although I have snapshots on a job server that I&#039;ve used very often for quick recovery but of course timing is everything.  Rollbacks on upgrades I like to use snapshots and in some cases even paused mirroring and failover if time is critical.  It all depends on the upgrade of course and severity of change.  There are many variables in order to decide your best rollback path.  Enough rambling...this would make a good write.  I&#039;ll try to get it up.  Very interested in hearing your comments always!]]></description>
