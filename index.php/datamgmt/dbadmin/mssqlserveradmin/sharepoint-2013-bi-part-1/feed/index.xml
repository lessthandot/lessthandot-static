to be honest, I have no idea.
I know you need SQL Server 2012 for the fancy BI features, but I&#039;m not sure what happens when you mix different SQL Server editions. You better consult with an actual SharePoint expert on this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Koen, &lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve followed your blog and finished successfully. Bu got a big problem making a BISM connection in PowerPivot gallery. The problem arises at verifying the connection and using it for Powerview. Tried several solutions, but none successfully.&lt;br /&gt;
Situation: &lt;br /&gt;
+ No domain&lt;br /&gt;
+ SPFarm is administrator, can access all databases RDMBS an SSAS&lt;br /&gt;
+ Stopped “Claims to Windows Token Service” and restarted IIS&lt;br /&gt;
Any ideas?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I was planning on just using a lot of the pre-configured images to handle the majority of the heavy lifting as I have this linked to an MSDN account. I think I&#039;d still need to upload a Sharepoint ISO, but not 100% sure about that. Also not sure if I should try to configure this as a single server or use the more correct configuration of multiple servers. Seeing that you have this step-by-step for a single server, I&#039;m leaning that way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Peter: the principles of setting up a VM for Azure would be the same. Not sure about the domain controller though. I left it out, but you might include it for your VM in the cloud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve been meaning to test this out, but here in Belgium we have quite slow upload speeds, so uploading 40GB into Azure is a bit problematic.]]></description>
