		<description><![CDATA[I prefer to give the SQL Server service account the ability to create it&#039;s own SPN within Active Directory. This eliminates the requirement to manually work with SPNs the vast majority of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It would be great given that you are showing how to manually set SPNs if you could do a follow up post that showed how to set the SPN for named instances of SQL Server as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@david peterson, I don&#039;t know for sure, but my speculation is that you would need to at least set up service accounts and spns in steps one and two for each of those services.  Past that I&#039;m not certain because I haven&#039;t gone into that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m guessing what you&#039;re trying to do is to have a cube set up in SSAS that you access via an SSRS report in report manager, and you&#039;re not wanting to just open the cube to everyone but would rather authenticate on the user running the report.  Am I close?]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
For SSAS and SSRS to talk to one another via Kerberos, do you need to run a SQL query?]]></description>
