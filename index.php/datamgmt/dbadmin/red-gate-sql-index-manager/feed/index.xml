		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for reviewing the first beta of SQL Index Manager.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I‚Äôm pleased to announce that we have a second beta available. Based on user feedback made a few improvements in this latest version:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¢	You can now select an individual database to analyse at a time&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¢	The index information is now sortable&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¢	The index fragmentation and size thresholds are now adjustable in the options dialog&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¢	The last connected to database instance is remembered for next time&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve fixed a few bugs and given the look and feel a bit more love&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new version can be downloaded from:&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Seems like the makings of another awesome tool by redgate.  here&#039;s my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The very first thing that I noticed was that it wouldn‚Äôt let me run it as administrator.  This is important to me because I have two separate accounts where I work, my every day privileges account and my elevated admin account.  My admin account is what I use to connect to sql server so now I have to switch users to run this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Definitely don‚Äôt like it defaulting to having all indexes selected to fix.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clicking on the Fix column heading trying to either select all of them or sort broke the application for me :-D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clicking the other column headings do nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hitting ctrl-a will select everything, but clicking on a ‚ÄúFix‚Äù button only deselects or selects that specific one.  Options to select or deselect all would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clicking Fix Indexes pop up a window, allowing you to let Redgate fix the index or to generate the script and let you run it.  Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The results don‚Äôt keep the list of indexes after closing and reopening the application.  It would be nice if it kept the server, database, index name, and when it was fixed so that DBAs could determine how often they‚Äôre fixing an index (so they can either schedule the fix or reevaluate the need for the index).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fixing an index doesn‚Äôt take it off the index analysis list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another nice to have is if it picked up the maintenance plans/jobs that reorg/build indexes.]]></description>
