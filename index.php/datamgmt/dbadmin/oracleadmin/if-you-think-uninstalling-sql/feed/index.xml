		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s difficult at all about uninstalling Sql Server. I install and uninstall it numerous times for users at work and it is as zero friction as you can get. Just hit next and then next. Really simple.   &lt;br /&gt;
 Looking at the Oracle uninstall process though looks to be truly horrific and filled with steps that should be automated without the user having to touch it very much at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is nothing easier than removing Oracle from Windows box. Hmm... Actually, I&#039;m wrong. It&#039;s even easier on Unix.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, if a OUI doesn&#039;t work the way you expected then stop all remaining Oracle services, remove directory where Oracle was installed. Then remove registry keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREORACLE. If you have any Oracle services left then remove them under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServices. Restart your computer. Done.]]></description>
