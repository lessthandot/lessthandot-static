		<description><![CDATA[This is a nice article, but I saw one grammatical error in the third paragraph where you&#039;ve stated &quot;but the AD admin ensured me&quot;. I think you meant to say &quot;but the AD admin assured me&quot;. This is not a major flaw, and the article on the whole was very engaging. Thanks for the post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also had this error in two other contexts:
1) A laptop has been logged-on to while not connected to the domain using cached credentials and subsequently connected to the domain.  for some reason file services were avaialable, but not a SQL Server connection!
2) Am intermittent problem from desktop connections where we think a transient network error has occurred or maybe a password was updated.  We&#039;ve never been able to find the cause as we can&#039;t replicate.

The solution in both cases was to log-out and back in again.]]></description>
