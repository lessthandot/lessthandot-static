		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bill,

which version of SSIS are you using? Behavior depends a bit if you&#039;re working pre or post SQL Server 2012.

Personally, I always use DontSaveSensitive. Passwords are either kept in a config table (connection set using environment variable) when using package deployment model or using parameters in the project deployment model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good article but I&#039;m left scratching my head on what would be a best practice when choosing a protection level.  I want to use the DontSaveSensitive protection level on my projects/packages but it makes it impossible to run them when in development (since configs are gone and sensitive info isn&#039;t saved).  So every time I deploy a project, I have to change the ProtectionLevel property of all of my project&#039;s packages to DontSaveSensitive.  Then change it back to one of the other choices when I need to do more development.  That seems awfully inefficient and prone to error.  Am I missing something here?]]></description>
