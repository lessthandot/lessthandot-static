		<description><![CDATA[Hi JK, thanks for the suggestion. I was thinking about the standard SSIS logging when I was writing the article, but then again I was too lazy ehrm ... busy to enable it. :)
The advantage of my custom logging (aside from all the extra work...) is that you control RunID yourself. For example, if I run 3 different packages but use the same RunIDs (1 to 20 in the post above), I can easily group on those to create a chart, which was the ultimate goal when I was writing the MSSQLTips article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Koen,

You could really do the same thing with the built-in package logging and a view against the dbo.sysssislog table:

&lt;code lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[PackageLogging] AS (
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY A.STARTTIME) AS ID
     , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY A.SOURCE ORDER BY A.STARTTIME) AS RunID
     , A.SOURCE AS PackageName
     , A.STARTTIME AS StartTime
     , B.STARTTIME AS EndTime
  FROM [dbo].[SYSSSISLOG] A
 INNER JOIN [dbo].[SYSSSISLOG] B
    ON A.EXECUTIONID = B.EXECUTIONID
   AND A.EVENT = &#039;PackageStart&#039;
   AND B.EVENT = &#039;PackageEnd&#039;
)&lt;/code&gt;

The only logging we enable is Error logging, but it has the handy side-effect of giving us package start and end times (and errors, which can also be nice!) No downside that I&#039;ve seen. And you could substitute RunID with EXECUTIONID if you wanted (which is stored as a GUID.)]]></description>
