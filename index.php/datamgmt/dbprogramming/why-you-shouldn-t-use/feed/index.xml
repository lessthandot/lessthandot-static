		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  I was not aware of the issues with view definitions actually returning incorrect data.  Only that new columns would not appear in the view without refreshing the view definition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another reason not to use SELECT * is maintainability.  There is no way to know the requirements of the application and whether it actually needs all the columns when maintaining code later on, not without a considerable amount of additional research and effort.  Not to mention, if you plan to drop an unused column you can&#039;t simply search the code base to make sure it is not being referenced anywhere.]]></description>
