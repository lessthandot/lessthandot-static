		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ted,

I have got a similar issue but I am running SQL 2012 on Windows Server 2012 R2 and importing 2007 excel file. I have tried your method but it still doesn&#039;t work. Do you think that will because of the OS that I am on? 

Thanks,
Howie]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I ran into this very error this past week with one of my developers in a dev environment.  What we ended up doing to resolve the issue was to assign NTFS permissions to the temp directory associated with the SQL Server service account.  I did not need to grant full rights to the entire profile, only this specific directory.  For some reason the Access engine is caching data in the appdata under the Service Account but when a non-privileged user attempts to access this through a linked server it is passing the credentials of this user all the way through the SQL stack and back to the OS and getting a permission denied resulting in a message similar to what you are seeing.]]></description>
