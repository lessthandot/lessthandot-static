		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little confused on what you mean as you are not really going anywhere with your statement.  Yes, it is not recommended to set DontSaveSensitive and you basically said the same thing, after your expert google search, to use EncryptSensitiveWithPassword.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You must do that on the server that the package lives if you have to to the key stays the same.  Remember, sql authentication is not recommended.  So to answer your question, use windows authentication.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your post; but, I must disagree with this statement:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: Using the Protection Level of DontSaveSensitive is not considered a best practice due to this setting bypassing all encryption of sensitive data in the package.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What would you consider being the best practice for the protection level setting?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on a quick Google search, I am not alone in thinking that setting it to DontSaveSensitive actually is the best practice approach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If you absolutely must save sensitive information in the package than I would recommend using the EncryptSensitiveWithPassword.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[BTW..this is an old thing...I remember the same with DTS..it works when I run the package in Enterprise Manager but doesn&#039;t work from a job...was almost always a permissions issue&lt;br /&gt;

I am sure in the future it will be the same]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And yes I got bit by the double hop issue....very annoying. The only other issue I had (knocking on wood now) is that I got an encryption error once and the only way to resolve it was to redeploy the package...very weird]]></description>
