		<description><![CDATA[I love the use of FOR XML Path to get a comma delimited lists that we need for reporting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And you didn&#039;t mention them specifically so I&#039;ll mention recursive CTES.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SSIS is harder than DTS but does so much more. And hooray for Fuzzy matching in it!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also like CTEs and cross apply. I would love using the date datatype (It would be so much easier to query if we didn&#039;t have to worrry with time for many of our purposes) but we have all the dates we need right now in datetime and that&#039;s not going to change, but if I was designing a new database, I&#039;d use date! And varchar(max) is just so much easier. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ll bet you can tell I&#039;m a data analyst and not a dba!&lt;br /&gt;
