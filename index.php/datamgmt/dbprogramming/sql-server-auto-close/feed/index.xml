		<description><![CDATA[I just found out that if you detach a database and then attach it again, in some cases the auto close option is set to true even if it was set to false before detaching it.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Robert, I went as far as doing a test install to the point this software does the DB create.  It set it by default on the creation of the database.  Not sure why the developers of the company thought that was necessary.  Typically just a model setting somehow set on and then they created their DB without noticing the affects.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another note:  this database server wasn&#039;t under my normal policy and now is.  This was 100% the DBAs fault (me) on not catching it until it was a performance issue.  So the end results, double check when databases are introduced into the servers.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
