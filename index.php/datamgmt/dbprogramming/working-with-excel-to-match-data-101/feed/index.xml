		<description><![CDATA[If at all possible we insist on a text file instead, but some clients can&#039;t provide one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So when forced to, we always convert the Excel file to a text file first and then import. It avoids most of the silly issues that Excel to SQL Server conversions have. The thing I hate most about Excel imports though is that they never have the same columns from run to run as the clients are using the file for some other purpose and have no problem with changing it and not telling us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, we still have some clients we have to export to Excel for, they won&#039;t even take csv files. Grr arrrrgh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post, but I still hate excel..especially when you mix numbers and letters in the same column or if you have a null value in the column...that will just hose up the import and skip those rows silently&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I prefer flat files/csv files]]></description>
