		<description><![CDATA[Hi -
Thank you for posting this script, I&#039;m hoping to get this working for myself too.  The one issue I&#039;m having is that my FullBackup variable is not being set.  When I hard-code this variable with a Full Backup File name it restores that file however this is suppose to be Dynamic.

All the other Dynamic variables are set as &#039;Fx&#039; or fuctions but the FullBackup variable doesn&#039;t have the same icon.  Is that my issue?  Do I need to set the expression myself and if is, what do I set that too?

any feedback is greatly appreciate.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ted,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am trying to run your solution.&lt;br /&gt;
Just doing it basic, not changing anything but the database name variables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Created the folders (c:restores and c:backups that you use in your solution and gave everyone full access. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When i execute the package i get that the &quot;script task is corrupted&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Then try to run it command line and get the following in the loggingrestore.txt :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An error occurred with the following error messages: &quot;Could not find a part of the path &#039;c:backups&#039;.&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot; &quot;Cannot open backup device &#039;c:restores&#039;. Operating system error 3(failed to retrieve text for this error. Reason: 15105).&lt;br /&gt;
RESTORE DATABASE is terminating abnormally.&quot;. Possible failure reasons: Problems with the query, &quot;ResultSet&quot; property not set correctly, parameters not set correctly, or connection not established correctly&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It looks like permission problems, but permissions do look good (everyone full) and I execute the package as myself (local admin and sa).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any ideas?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do the following for about 6 or 7 databases that I backup and restore between 2 servers every night. These are small databases (less than 40 GB). I also just do a full backup and don&#039;t need differential, I do like all the options you have in your SSIS package, I have to check it out&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
it is a  3 step SQLAgent job&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

--Step 1, this will backup the DB to the server I want it restored to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;exec OrigServer.MyDataBase.dbo.prBackupMyDataBase&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--step 2 restore DB and fix permissions&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;USE master&lt;br /&gt;
GO&lt;br /&gt;
ALTER DATABASE MyDataBase SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE&lt;br /&gt;
GO&lt;br /&gt;
RESTORE DATABASE MyDataBase FROM  DISK = N&#039;D:MyDataBase.BAK&#039; WITH  FILE = 1,  &lt;br /&gt;

Use MyDataBase&lt;br /&gt;

EXECUTE sp_change_users_login &#039;Update_One&#039;, &#039;SomeName&#039;, &#039;SomeName&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--Step 3 is a Operating System command&lt;br /&gt;
