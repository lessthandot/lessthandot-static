		<description><![CDATA[Hi ..

I have got a typical problem.
I connect to DB2 from sql server management studi and execute a stored procedure:
EXEC (&#039;CALL ENROLLMENT(&#039;&#039;20140601&#039;&#039;,&#039;&#039;20140901&#039;&#039;)&#039;)At db2serverName

This statement returns two result sets with the following columns:
Recordset 1: Hdr, UserRn, MemberRn, MemberIdentifier, MemberDOB
Recordset 2: Hdr, MemberRn, MemberIdentifier, PlanId, StartDt, EndDt, Rate, Amount

1st recordset is basically the header and 2nd recordset is the detail

I have to create two xml files using the above stored procedure. I am not sure how to handle two recordsets being returned from the above stored proc]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Is there a way I can get the XML output in the below format (all elements in newline):


  
    File.txt
    
    196
    0
    ALIS Balancing XML message
  


 Right now everything appears in the single line format with the above approach:

File.txt4720ALIS Balancing XML message]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,&lt;br /&gt;
I am new to the blog...and SSIS. I have tried all of the above. And I now get a file that says System._ComObject. Before I was getting one that said had the begining tags I needed (opening and closing roots). But no information. Each time I would change one thing I would get a million errors...so. Now I don&#039;t know what works and what does not. So the actual XML file I need I have a SQL script for...and the XML file comes out perfect for my needs. But I don&#039;t know how to save it and then be able to move it to a share drive, so that the information contained insided can be uploaded to another application...which REQUIRES XML Explicit format. &lt;br /&gt;
Can you help? &lt;br /&gt;
