		<description><![CDATA[One of our vendors used a trigger and xp_cmdshell to execute an aplication.  The application was being being blocked by the locks held by the trigger.  SQL Server could not detect this as a deadlock, so would block forever.  The solution was a commit in the trigger.  Now that&#039;s intgeration!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I updated the trigger to queue the request in a new table.  A job processed the queue and called the application.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PS Insert querys to a trigger with a commit do not behave as expected.  Adding the begin tran makes it seem a little more normal.  BTW, a commit in a trigger is not supported by Microsoft.]]></description>

In fact I don&#039;t know why Microsoft don&#039;t make a SSSB trigger type - considering how well it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sp_oa* procs inside of a trigger - those are the best. Amazing how quickly they stop working completely - never to restart again.  And a major lesson learned - get the app developers to actually write the correct code instead of hacking the database (again).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See, now I&#039;ve never gone quite that far...well, I&#039;m not telling you if I have ;-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best part about this trigger mentioned is it was in a DMZ so I actually had to open up some things just to get it to work.  Back then I wasn&#039;t all that smart on how that &quot;stuff&quot; worked.  Wow, how bad was that! Just saying it now makes my head hurt.]]></description>
