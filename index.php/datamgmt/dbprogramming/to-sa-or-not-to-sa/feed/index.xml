		<description><![CDATA[Interesting question Jack.  I think that is the next level of conversation on the topic though.  Sense sysadmin is a role and sa is a login they are slighly apart from each other.  The reason sa and sysadmin can do the same is sa is typically in sysadmin.  This is the same as the first thing you do is remove BUILTINADMINs from the sysadmin role.  If you don&#039;t. domain admins typically can do whatever they want.  scary stuff.  The DBA question is also a good one.  Team settign DBA would only be sysadmin on what they are in charge of.  There would be a trust level here to overap that.  If you can&#039;t trust your DBAs then who can you trust to secure and keep the data available :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And yes, the sa on jobs drives me nuts also.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about SYSADMINs? I&#039;m not aware of anything SA can do that SYSADMINs can&#039;t - other than being a default account that everyone assumes exists (which maybe part of the reason for the SQL Agent Job ownership). So do you make all your DBAs SYSADMINs?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In it&#039;s current incarnation,  SQL Server no longer requires an SA account.  There are those of us who like it there because it&#039;s familiar, but it&#039;s really not needed any more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why shouldn&#039;t it it be used for application logins,  developers, or other users ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I submit the reasons are obvious.  Just like I wouldn&#039;t share out the password for my personal privileged account,  the SA account should be treated the same way, period.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post.  I prefer to disable the sa account.  If needed, I&#039;ll create a similar account with a different name and leave it for extreme emergency access.  Of course, the password is typically know only by the person that sets it.  And a copy of the password kept in a safe or other secured location in the event the account is needed.  Like when there is only a single DBA and the DBA is on vacation and something that requires sysadmin access comes up.]]></description>
