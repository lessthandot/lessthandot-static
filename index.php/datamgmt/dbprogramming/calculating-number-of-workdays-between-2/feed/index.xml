		<description><![CDATA[Ken, all you need is a holiday/non working day table in addition to this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
you do this calculation and then you subtract the days in the holiday table and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a holiday table that covers over 90 different countries and it even accounts for short trading days]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ken, I will agree with you. But when you are writing a blog or article, you cannot cover all the cases. u use this as starting point and convert it as per requirements.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Nice math, too bad it is total bull. For one full year you will get between 260 to 262 workdays.&lt;br /&gt;
The actual number of workdays all depends on the recognized holidays you company recognizes.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you work a 10/4 workweek? (10 hours for 4 days a week. Maybe from Friday to Monday? Never taking a day off you have 208 to 210 workdays in a year.)&lt;br /&gt;
What about the companies open 24/7? The company workdays are 365 to 366 in a year. Don&#039;t count company workdays? Then you need to remove your vacation days!&lt;br /&gt;
What about when you work from 10PM to 6:30AM? Is one shift 1 or 2 workdays?&lt;br /&gt;
When I was a teenager, I worked from 9 to 9:30 (PM to AM) for 6 days a week during summer. I had 92 workdays a year then. (June 1st through August 31) OK, it wasn&#039;t exactly those days, I don&#039;t remember which days I worked.]]></description>
