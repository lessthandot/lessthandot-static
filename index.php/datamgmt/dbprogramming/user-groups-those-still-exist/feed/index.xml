		<description><![CDATA[Jes,&lt;br /&gt;
You truly are an inspiration for a lot of SQL server professionals and I am proud to be one of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We met in person 2 years ago at SQL Saturday in Chicago where you drove hundreds of miles to learn and to volunteer. One year later you were presenting and encouraged me to do the same. Inside I felt inspired to follow your tracks and 3 months later I presented for the first time at a SQL Saturday in Indianapolis. &lt;br /&gt;
It was awesome and the feedback I got made me understand what you are preaching. &lt;br /&gt;
I honestly believe that you were the inspiration for this and want to thank you again for all the amazing work you do for the SQL Server community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank You!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed the post, Jes.  I couldn&#039;t agree more.&lt;br /&gt;

For those thinking of starting a local PASS Chapter, I just posted a Chapter quick start guide at http://www.sqlpass.org/PASSChapters/FastTrackChapterStartUpGuide.aspx.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Good stuff about users groups Jes...getting people involved in leadership or by speaking really helps them grow.  In Denver we even had a meeting a couple of years ago where people that had never presented spoke for 10 minutes and the we gave them feedback and constructive criticism to help them become speakers.  I presented for the first time at the UG 3 years ago and I&#039;ll also be speaking at the PASS Summit this year.  See you there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike - I agree! Starting a user group is completely manageable, especially if you have one or two other people to help you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jon - Yes, sponsors are GREAT! I&#039;ll have the MADPASS director in charge of sponsorships talk to you soon. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leonard - You make some great points. Thanks again for being so involved!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the shout-out! I have to agree with all of your points. User groups are a brilliant idea - particularly for people in smaller organizations who don&#039;t have an internal network of contacts they can turn to for help. Plus, I&#039;ve paid for trainings that aren&#039;t as good or as useful as the presentations I&#039;ve seen for free. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For all those who don&#039;t get training because their company doesn&#039;t have a budget, or who want to stay on top of new developments in their industry (which should be everybody!) - user groups are the answer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike&#039;s right and I would add that there&#039;s plenty of vendors willing to sponsor you with a new or existing group.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We do them all the time, whether it be simply sending some swag or sending one of our DBA&#039;s to do a demo or training.  The hot topic lately being tuning SQL in a VMware environment (yes - this is a bit of a plug for our latest IgniteVM product).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, life long learning is what sets the pros apart from the &quot;workers&quot; - which are you? :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, Jes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would add - If you don&#039;t find a localish group in INETA/GITCA/PASS/etc - consider starting one! It isn&#039;t the most difficult thing to do in the world, if you have the right time and there is a huge support network of chapter leaders to advise you and help you on the road to a local user group.]]></description>
