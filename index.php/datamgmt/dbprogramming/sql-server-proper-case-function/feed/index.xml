		<description><![CDATA[Hi George,

I was doing some research for something else and I came across this fine article of yours once again.  I know I&#039;ve already commented on it but I just wanted to say thanks again.

I also wanted people to know that sometimes the way UDFs are tested make all the difference in the world.  If you&#039;re testing an iTVF (Inline Table Valued Function), then there&#039;s no problem with using SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON.  If you&#039;re testing an sF (Scalar Function) or an mTVF (Multi-statement Table Valued Function), the simple act of turning SET STATISTICS to ON changes things a whole lot and makes the functions look like they perform a lot worse than they really do.  I&#039;m not suggesting for a minute that sF&#039;s and mTVF&#039;s are ok in every case but, in the words of a much wiser man, &quot;If you measure it, you change it&quot;. 

With that in mind, here&#039;s an article on how to properly test sF&#039;s and mTVF&#039;s and it includes a method (if you can write it as a single query) to create an &quot;iSF&quot; (Inline Scalar Function) that some folks might not be aware of.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/T-SQL/91724/&quot; title=&quot;How to Make Scalar UDFs Run Faster (SQL Spackle)
&quot;&gt; 


Thanks again for all that you do, George.  You&#039;re truly one of the &quot;good guys&quot; in this business.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very efficient... if you don&#039;t have special international characters: B√ñLL becomes B√ñLl while it should be B√∂ll :(&lt;br /&gt;
I have tried to use another case-sensitive collation like SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS (SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AI is my default), but the performance is terrible beyond 20 rows.&lt;br /&gt;
Any idea how to tackle this ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much, for my case i use a data warehouse so performance is not a issue, i just wanted something simple and i&#039;ve got it. About Joe&#039;s or O&#039;Bryan, it is minimum, it is really good to transform capital texts which are hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;

How they say here in New Zealand, Cher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much George for your support and for encouraging me. I&#039;m sure that I&#039;ll always have something new to learn. It&#039;s a little harder at the beginning but it&#039;s so interesting and useful! It worths the effort. So I&#039;ll try to do my best! Thank you again!]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
As a beginner, you should realize that the functionality presented in this blog is not &#039;normal&#039;.  From a database perspective, this functionality should never be necessary because databases are, at a fundamental level, meant to store and retrieve data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, database programmers are often required to clean up data, which is where this type of functionality becomes useful.  From a database purist perspective, the database should not be modifying your data, it should simply be storing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wish you well in your studies.  My best advice to you is to realize that your learning will never be done.  I&#039;ve been using Microsoft SQL Server for 10 years and I still find new things to learn.]]></description>
