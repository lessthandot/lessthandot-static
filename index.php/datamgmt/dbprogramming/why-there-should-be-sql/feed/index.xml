&lt;br /&gt;
I really appreciate your answers. I went to the past editions of SQL Server Days and it&#039;s indeed a great event and I understand the decision but nevertheless I still stand by my post.&lt;br /&gt;
See you at the SQL Server Days ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I am the SQL Server lead for Microsoft in BeLux and wanted to give my support to the TechDays team on this decision. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In BeLux, together with the SQL Server User Group we spend a lot of time and effort creating a top notch SQL Server Days every year around the November/December timeframe. You can check out what we did last November here : http://www.sqlserverdays.be/ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since the SQL Server Days covers the different aspects of SQL Server from a technical level, the question then becomes if we should still add one or two SQL Server sessions in a broad event like the TechDays. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the past we tried this and we had fairly low interest in these sessions. So we have decided against doing that for a few years now and focus on the SQL Server Days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the feedback we&#039;ve seen this year, I think we&#039;ll reconsider it for the TechDays 2014 edition. Make sure to make your voices heard and join us all for the SQL Server Days 2013 in November/December.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a limited number of session slots at the TechDays and a lot of content to cover. This year we are focusing on products e just launched. Office, SharePoint, Lync, Exchange, Windows Server 2012, System Center SP1, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, etc... so you can imagine that it is difficult to add sql content to the conference like we did last year. In the past we saw a very low attendance in most of sql sessions we organized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So had to make choices and decided that it has no point in doing 1 sql session....]]></description>
