		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ken&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;pick zero to any number of whitespace characters&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
/s{0,} accomplishes that task&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is a good point and the first pattern I wrote had it in there but see I didn&#039;t include it in here.  Wish T-SQL didn&#039;t allow that aspect.  Messy to say the least&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOLOCK is an abused hint when it comes down to it.  In my experience, once it is found that the effects from overusing it are actually understood in the fact that data comes back incorrect at times then the task comes up to remove it and use proper tuning to prevent long locks or the types of locks at times to accomplish the needs.  I&#039;ve had to sift through scripts well into the hundreds of lines to remove them before and wish I had thought of something like this years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NOLOCK without WITH works fine on SQL 2008. As far as I can remember, the WITH hint has always required () to define the scope.&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT * FROM dbo.tbl NOLOCK&lt;br /&gt;
works fine in SQL 2000 and 2008 as long as a table &quot;dbo.tbl&quot; exists.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe the following would have failed in SQL 2000 as well.&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT * FROM dbo.tbl WITH NOLOCK&lt;br /&gt;
(I don&#039;t care to know that I am wrong about that.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
REGEX isn&#039;t nonsense, but it is hard to read and remember. What would you use to pick zero to any number of whitespace characters? (space, tab, carriage return, line feed, etc.) I didn&#039;t see you use it in your article, but that is probably because I forgot how to write it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know of any articles on why you would want to remove NOLOCK hints. (I know the locking behavior in 2000 and 2008 isn&#039;t the same. Is there anything that documents that NOLOCK will be going away in future releases?)]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
So could you make this add &quot;SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED&quot; once a the top of the file for each file that you find one of these patterns in?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nope.  It came up last night and I couldn&#039;t remember so I had to try it and it does fail as&lt;br /&gt;
WITH NOLOCK&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I chalked that one up to helping with syntax errors :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way can you even use NOLOCK hints without parentheses and WITH anymore since SQL 2005?]]></description>
