		<description><![CDATA[Thw xp_commandshell is not a security hazard by itself. Getting SA on the database is what you should protect. It can be a simple matter if you have these recommendations in mind:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Disable the &quot;SA&quot; account;&lt;br /&gt;
2. Don&#039;t run the database services as &quot;system/localsystem&quot;, but eith domain accounts&lt;br /&gt;
3. Use mixed authentication, with personal Windows AD accounts for the DBA team members&lt;br /&gt;
4. Provide SQL Logins with RW privileges for the Apps&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Disabling or keeping the xp_commandshell is just a cherry on top of the security cake. And still there alternatives like powershell and SQLCLR. &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ted,

Many thanks for well-written post. I found it useful. As a blogger I&#039;m wondering if you could do me a favor and let me know which plugin you use to show the SQL codes?
I use HyperCode and the shown codes on the screen are ugly and unorganized. Is it shown using a plugin?

Thanks in advance.
Cheers,
Nazila]]></description>
