		<description><![CDATA[I did some pretty unofficial testing with a SQL CLR function similar to this and saw a drastic performance difference when using the SqlTypes instead of the native data types.  Using the native data type (as you have in your example) performed much better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just thought I&#039;d throw that out here as an FYI.&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for the post Alex.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha, I had to reference your article on deployment over @ http://aspnetlibrary.com/ pretty heavily (in my old posting, I never discussed deployment, just linked to your tutorial).  Since the idea was to have everything in one place, figured I should include those bits as well.  So nice work to you also :)]]></description>
