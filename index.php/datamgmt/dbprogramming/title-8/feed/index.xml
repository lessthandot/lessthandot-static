		<description><![CDATA[HyperBac for SQL Server is another one you should add to the list for third party SQL compression.  It was developed by original developers of LiteSpeed, and has a completely different file system architecture which gives it numerous advantages over LiteSpeed and others, giving you the same speed and compression, with much more flexibility, extensibility, seamless native integration and most importantly much lower licensing and maintenance cost, a must for hardcore SQL DBAs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s good news on Avamar.  I swear I didn&#039;t give you up to them.  Not sure how they &quot;found you&quot;.  If you want go ahead and start a thread in the forums also on any setup/cons/pros/general quetsions you have.  There are a ew of us using it and I bet we can get some good content out there]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would you believe that they found me and gave me a call?  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From their lips:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
compression around 85% reduction&lt;br /&gt;
time Spent 70% faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They did state that it all depends ;-&gt; on my hardware as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
they also stated that it is a preprocessor to what SQL Server does and that my having Avamar will not be effected in any way and that Avamar will take the now smaller output file and still deposit it on the linux share.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sounds pretty cool to me that I don&#039;t lose investment $$$ on not being able to use Avamar.     &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Steve.  I&#039;ll follow up with stats shortly.  I higly recommend downloading the trial though.  LiteSpeed has a extremely good backup analyzer that you can run to gain the advantage quickly over these statistics.  I&#039;ve added the image into the blog on a small database to show testing on compression rates.  To give really hard numbers is hard and they do have statistical papers showing in their labs on servers you may be able to base off over my servers and configurations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can we get some times and sizes before compression and after?  How about delta in size as well?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking at sub 1TB db and I want to reduce the time for backup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also is a restore going to be faster or slower from a compressed backup?  Same size db.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TIA&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Denis.  Yes, I just recently (within the last week) added SQLCompare and Data Compare to my tools.  I was asking for it here for quite some time and finally got it.  It has saved me countless SMO scripting time :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was going to blog on monitoring tools but to put it here, I also use Idera for monitoring.  However I will be mixing that up with a upcoming purchase of Quests Oracle monitoring tools.  That is important to note for others in picking monitoring tools.  Plan for the future and see if the company has the ability to imcorporate more types of database servers over the primary one.  Would make life easier if my selection would have been more accommodating to SQL Server and Oracle]]></description>
