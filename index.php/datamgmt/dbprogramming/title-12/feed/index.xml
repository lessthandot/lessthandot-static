		<description><![CDATA[I need to import from a XML file into a SQL server table. The table exits already with data, I really need to do insert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have about 80 XML files, and need to inset into 80 different tables. Each table has about 50 columns. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I read xml data into DataSet, then use SqlBuldCopy to insert into the table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, I am encountering the problem:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
System.InvalidOperationException       {&quot;The given value of type String from the data source cannot be converted to type int of the specified target column.&quot;}        &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
InnerException            {&quot;Failed to convert parameter value from a String to a Int32.&quot;}           &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I just thought about, can SQLBulkCopy do ‚ÄúInsert into‚Äù data to an existing table with Data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
what will be a good way to do this task?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,  Thanks for the comments :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From what you have there I think you can get this done quickly by using a foreach enumerator with a data flow task inside it.  Each iteration of the foreach on an mdb file would set a variable as the source of the data flow task.  if the mappings are completely different on the mdb&#039;s you may be better off getting the mdbs into a directory in which the mappings all match or create a script task to set the mappings in the foreach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This may be better off asked in the forums here on LTD also.  I&#039;m just throwing up a very high level of the process.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very good article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you have any examples of how to use SISS for importing data from &lt;br /&gt;
multiple source files in a subdirectory?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have been tasked with migrating all data that is currently in the Access Databases to MS SQL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a total of 366 MDB files spread access the various departments.  Most of these are either not being used now or are left overs from a previous conversion project(before my time) or previous versions of the DB Application.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After attempting to eliminate the &quot;junk&quot; I am left with somewhere around 100 or so files that will need to be migrated into SQL server.  Of those files a dozen or so are the Accual Access Applications that are in use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, right now I am attempting to write a few scripts to import the data from the &quot;archives&quot; of the dozen or so Access Applications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the data has been put into SQL server I will then start to modify the Access Applications forms, and reports to point to SQL server instead of using the local DBs and convert the Access queries to SQL queries on MS SQL. In short convert the Access Applications to Access Projects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One other challenge that I have found with this project is that many of the Access Applications use linked tables to pull data from each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The two largest of the Access Applications are Monthly and eWARTZ both of which don&#039;t link to other data sources, but other Access Applications link to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because I have not had much experience with Applications built on Access the difference in data types has been a bit of a problem, but I have been able to solve most.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The SSMA (SQL Server Migration Assistant) from MS has been a useful tool but lacks the ability to import multiple files into the same tables.  It wants to overwrite the previous data. (truncate the tables before starting the next file.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I started down the OPENROWSET road to be able to append the data from each of the Access DBs semi-manualy. As I got further into this I found that as the Access Application grew so did the tables.  The eWARTZ Application has had about 8 columns added to it.  So I have a table on the SQL server that has ALL Columns but need to adjust the insert statement to account for the older archived data and pad the archived data with defaault values for the missing column data during the insert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope this helps explain what I am trying to get accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks so much for your help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two further methods I often use for small Excel / CSV where the SQL table is already defined (append):&lt;br /&gt;
1) Copy + Paste (yes!), if you have the table already defined then you can often copy+paste the contents of the excel file directly in to one of the Management Studio &#039;Edit 200 rows&#039; windows.  Note that network latency to the SQL Server can be a real issue with this though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2) Use the Excel CONCATENATE function to generate an INSERT () VALUES compatible statement for each row.  SQL Server 2008 allows us to not repeat the whole INSERT statement so this can be relatively efficient.&lt;br /&gt;
Then copy+paste the resulting &#039;SQL&#039; statement from Excel in to Management studio.  I find this approach is good where there are few columns (&#060;5) and not too many rows.]]></description>
