		<description><![CDATA[A paper on &quot;SQL Server 2005 Waits and Queues&quot; indicates that this can be considered a database design issue.  In particular, if your server&#039;s role is OLTP - many small data transactions representing the ongoing running of your business - the working data should be mostly in cache.  If it isn&#039;t, that implies that some process that reads a lot of data has taken up a lot of the cache space.  This doesn&#039;t tell you what the process was, but it may be something that should be redesigned, for instance by adding an index for a query to use instead of a table scan.  Or it may be an occasional hazard that you have to live with, such as running the CEO&#039;s daily report.

Evidently the cache hit ratio reflects the latest activity on the server but not a cumulative figure since the last restart - I hope I&#039;ve got that right.  Bad performance is said to be if the ratio goes below 90% for more than a minute for an OLTP system.  Or, if your users are complaining.  

My impression is that your verbal statement of &quot;divide Buffer cache hit ratio base by Buffer cache hit ratio&quot; is back-to-front while your script is correct (thanks for saving me from writing it - not that I couldn&#039;t), but this may be an English language issue between us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is very helpful. Here we are only getting the counters related to the SQL instance.I have a new requirement, i need to retrive some system related/custom counters and should display in my application. As my application is fully configurable module i would like to do the same like the previous approach so that i no need to touch my application for this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there any way to get system related/custom counter details other then SQL Server counters from system views?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please guide me on this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regards,&lt;br /&gt;
