		<description><![CDATA[Clutter could indeed become an issue.  Unless you call it &quot;Koen&#039;s Test Job&quot; and rename your package to something like &quot;KoenTestJob.dtsx&quot; while deploying :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes me think of something I wish they&#039;d had implemented: the ability to group jobs together (just for UI purposes). That would really help to avoid clutter in the Job Activity Monitor and we&#039;d be able to put jobs of the same project in their own folder...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention! :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#039;s actually a better &quot;solution&quot; than logging on to the remote server. Just create a job on that server to run the package. Then you can use SSMS on your client PC to start the job and thus you&#039;re running the package on the remote server.]]></description>
