		<description><![CDATA[My favorite teacher??? Mr. C (Christensen). I had him for Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry, and Biochemistry. He was not only an amazing high school teacher with a passion for the same things as me (Science and Star Trek TNG), but he was sort of a father figure to me. That&#039;s a whole different story... He was always available to talk, get support, and answer questions. He always encouraged me...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, he was honest with his students about what to expect out of life. It was important to him to not only teach us the curriculum, but also how to study and prepare for college. Because of him (and the fact that my Grandpa was also a HS Science teacher), I really wanted to be a science teacher. Unfortunately, I struggled with math and the formulas, and was unable to pursue a degree in science. I&#039;m better with little kids anyway, and I do tend to be somewhat science heavy in my curriculum. I share my love of science with little kids. It&#039;s awesome!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you Mr. C for always believing in me!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great job, always love seeing the journeys others have taken in their careers and the lessons they&#039;ve learned. As for the homework assignment I had a teacher in 7th grade (unfortunately I can&#039;t remember her name) who taught computer classes and she really lit the fire for me to really pursue computing. In her class we were doing basic programs and just drawing pictures using BASIC but she soon realized that a buddy of mine and myself were more advanced than some of the other students. She invited us to come in to class early and run defrag commands and basic system maintenance on all the lab computers. It was something simple but I remember how much I absolutely LOVED it and how it caused me to just want to keep learning more about what I could do with these wonderful machines than just draw intricate pictures of Sub-Zero and Scorpion in BASIC!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The teacher that inspired me the most....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t remember her name, but I will never forget her.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.  The hardest class I ever took was &quot;Field and Wave Electromagnetics II&quot;.  This class was extremely difficult for me, and I struggled a lot.  I had a great group of friends to support me and we studied a lot for that class.  We studied in the Library, in the dining hall during dinner, in various dorm rooms, etc... I never worked so hard for a single class, primarily because I wasn&#039;t &quot;getting it&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In my college (Rochester Institute of Technology), there was a policy that you could withdraw from a class prior to a certain date, and the grade wouldn&#039;t show on your transcript.  That date happened to be the same day as the mid-term exam.  I studied, studied, and studied some more.  I studied alone and with friends.  The exam had 4 questions, I skimmed through them at the start of the exam.  I tackled one question, but realized I had no clue how to solve the other ones.  1/2 way through the exam, I got up and handed in my paper.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I gave my unfinished exam to the teacher, I said, &quot;I&#039;ll be back later today with my withdrawal form&quot;.  She looked at me, glanced at my exam paper, and then looked at me again and said, &quot;I think that&#039;s a good idea&quot;.  I&#039;ll never forget the look on her face, the tone of her voice, or how I felt at that very moment.  I was devastated at my own failure, but she was calm and understanding.  Not at all judgmental.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took the same class a year later, with the same professor, and I aced it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must honestly admit that I don&#039;t remember anything about field and wave electromagnetics, standing waves, or transmission line theory.  What I remember from her is... Failure IS an option, as long as you can learn from it.  She allowed me to fail gracefully which ultimately allowed me to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Wonderful post, thanks for sharing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a very tiny sample set, I&#039;ve noticed that many of the female SQL &quot;thought leaders&quot; came to IT via a non-traditional path.  I&#039;m wondering if that is because many DBAs didn&#039;t get into IT via traditional paths or is it mostly the women?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe that would be a good question for WIT panels.]]></description>
