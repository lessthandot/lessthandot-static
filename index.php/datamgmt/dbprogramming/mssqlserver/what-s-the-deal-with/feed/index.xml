		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this article - it helped me to find what I think is a more universal solution.

Based on my research, I also found another product i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://zappysys.com/blog/get-data-google-spreadsheet-using-ssis/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SSIS Google Sheet API &lt;/a&gt; which is used for connecting and interacting with Google Spreadsheet data.
Hope It will helpful for others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice way,
You have really done informative post and all the things you have discussed in well proper way. Recently I have got a relevant post regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://zappysys.com/products/ssis-powerpack/ssis-mongodb-source/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; SSIS Mongodb source &lt;/a&gt;, This will help to extract large amount of data from MongoDB Database. This component supports SQL like query language to query MongoDB data without worrying about complex API or proprietary query language. MongoDB is an open-source document database, and the most popular NoSQL database out there. 

To see package follow this &lt;a href=&quot;http://zappysys.com/products/ssis-powerpack/ssis-mongodb-source/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Link&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently used Script task to import/export Excel files with EPPlus package. The script is a generic solution, meaning it is not targeted for a specific table. It is kind of tricky because there are so many combinations of data types in and out, plus null and not null. But, it gets the jobs done so far. I didn&#039;t have many test cases, so I am expecting more bugs in the future. If you are loading Excel to a specific table with known columns and types, it would be much easier. (Note: EPPlus does not need to be in GAC, see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dbrowne/archive/2014/06/25/how-to-load-an-assembly-in-a-ssis-script-task-that-isn-t-in-the-gac.aspx.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stewart.

I have no new ideas. Typically the combination of IMEX and TypeGuessRows works for me. In some scenarios I had to tinker with the columns in the advanced editor of the excel source. Since you tried all that, I have no other options available, sorry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mine for some reason seems to have no effect when i set imex=1 and change the TypeGuessRows to 0. When i look in the advanced settings of my excel task there metadatas are all text and nothing obscure like integer and so on.

But when it comes to importing my excel file it still Nulls any text in columns where the first rows are a number. The only way to get around it is to physically change the column format from general to text in the spreadsheet.

Im out of ideas now and its annoying. Any ideas?]]></description>
