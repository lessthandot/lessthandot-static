		<description><![CDATA[Naomi, I don&#039;t use A and B either except if the table names lend themselves to those letters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henk, I went down the same path you did and like your thinking, but I would never put AND on its own line, so while you&#039;re right that INNER JOIN is like an operator applied to two arguments, I still format my JOINs the same way I do my WHERE clauses:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Condition1&lt;br /&gt;
AND Condition2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can&#039;t think of a programming language construct that naturally puts an operator on its own line between two operands.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using yet another convention; formatting the join so that it really looks like an operator applied to two arguments:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT&lt;br /&gt;
___*&lt;br /&gt;
FROM&lt;br /&gt;
___table1&lt;br /&gt;
______INNER JOIN&lt;br /&gt;
___table2 ON (table1.foo = table2.bar)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, there isn&#039;t really any widely agreed upon formatting convention for SQL. Java, C, C++, they all have various widely recognized conventions, but not so for SQL. Basically, every other programmer does it differently and every other such programmer thinks her or her style is the best.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I have the exact opposite opinion. I prefer referring to the other table first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps this is because I generally put one-condition ON clauses on the same line as the table name. The point is that I have to read the joined table name in the first place, so going just a few more characters to find the other table alias is easier than scanning all the way to the end of the line:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FROM&lt;br /&gt;
   TableA A&lt;br /&gt;
   INNER JOIN TableB B ON A.ID = B.ID&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I&#039;m scanning only a few characters, &quot;B ON A&quot; and I already know which two tables are being joined.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good idea, Rudy.  I think I had seen someone else mention it (perhaps Emtucifor), too, and I had forgotten but it makes sense to do it that way.  And yes, I should have used &quot;convention&quot; and not &quot;standard&quot; but the premise is still the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the input!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[perhaps you should have said &quot;convention&quot; instead of &quot;standard&quot; because &quot;standard&quot; might cause confusion with regards to the SQL standard&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
in any case, putting the right table&#039;s column first in the ON clause is better because the intent of the join becomes clearer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
clearer because a joined table must always reference a previously-mentioned table, and this previously-mentioned table&#039;s column then &quot;sticks out&quot; when the SQL is formatted properly&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
clearer also because additional columns line up nicely&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT one.foo&lt;br /&gt;
_____, one.bar&lt;br /&gt;
_____, two,qux&lt;br /&gt;
__FROM one&lt;br /&gt;
LEFT OUTER&lt;br /&gt;
__JOIN two&lt;br /&gt;
____ON two.one_id = one.id&lt;br /&gt;
___AND two.fap = 42&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
unfortunately because of limitations in this comment box i have had to use underscores to represent spaces, so as to achieve the &lt;del&gt;correct&lt;/del&gt; approximate indentation and formatting effect&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
anyhow, notice how the &quot;two&quot; columns are all stacked up? and how the &quot;one&quot; column sticks out so that you can visually reference its previously-mentioned table higher up in the code&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
clarity in SQL is achieved by indentation, line breaks, and conventions such as this]]></description>
