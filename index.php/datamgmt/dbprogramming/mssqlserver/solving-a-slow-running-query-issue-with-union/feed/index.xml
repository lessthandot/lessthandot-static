		<description><![CDATA[Hey Steve,

not sure. I don&#039;t have access to the code anymore :)
Shouldn&#039;t IIF and CASE result in exactly the same execution plan though?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting trick
I suppose that using the Union forces the optimizer to execute a distinct on the records.
You could maybe achieve the same results by using a group by to have only one record by Contract in the CTE query]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Francesco: this query has a very specific layout of course. But a CTE is basically just a subquery, so I can imagine there are other queries where this trick can be applied. The important factors here are that a subquery is joined against another table, and that the subquery is either calculated before or after the join in the query plan. If after, there might be performance issues because there is no join predicate, as you can see in one of the query plans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good info.  Great example Koen!
It is interesting to figure out why the database engine or optimizer does things under certain circumstances.
In this case, finding a way to force the processing of the CTE first is slick.
Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevan,

that might be a good reason as  well. The UNION reason is just a theory in my head :)
Since this code is used in a table-valued function, I could not use a temp table, hence the UNION solution.]]></description>
