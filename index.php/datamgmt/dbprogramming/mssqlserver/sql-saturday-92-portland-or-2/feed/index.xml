		<description><![CDATA[Jes, I attended your SSRS presentation at SQL Saturday in Portland.  I thought it was outstanding!!  In fact, it was the best presentation of all the ones I attended that day.  It was also the most humorous presentation and often that&#039;s just what people need in order to really learn something.  I wish I had a chance to meet with you personally.  Congratulations at the Portland Marathon!!   I hope to see you out here in Portland again in the near future.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers,  John Franko]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post Jes!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was nice to meet you in Portland (#sqlSat92) and Seattle (#sqlPass) too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, I could not make a visit to Voodoo Doughnuts (although, I know it is one of the must to-do in Portland).. but will do in the next year (hopefully)!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take care.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[If that&#039;s the worst presentation you&#039;ve ever given, you&#039;re doin&#039; pretty freaking well. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I really enjoyed your presentation at SQL Saturday 92. You got a little behind in terms of the scope you wanted to cover, but you didn&#039;t really waste any time-- when you were answering those questions you were doing demos that showed things to the audience. You did it clearly and with enthusiasm and everyone was really with you-- and having people with you is what counts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So even if you&#039;d handle the presentation differently another time, I&#039;d still chalk that one up in the &quot;big success&quot; areas. Because you were very successful at teaching what you brought, and making us all want to learn more.]]></description>
