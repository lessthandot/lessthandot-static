		<description><![CDATA[You scared me for a second, this is still supported in this version and the next version as well&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following SQL Server Database Engine features are supported in the next version of SQL Server, but will be removed in a later version. The specific version of SQL Server has not been determined.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
so people that are implementing 2012 are still fine but they might want to think what they will do in the year 2012...perhaps Hadoop replication on Azure  ;-0]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Yes, Iâ€™ll have a hard time selling the upgrade for this one major fact but that is our jobs; show why SQL Server is as good or a better choice and worth the cost.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Funny, I always thought our job was to administer data not be marketing goons. If SQL Server wants to price itself out of the game, then we just simply recommend a different platform that gets the job done. If a company has gotten so in bed with a product that they can&#039;t leave it, then they just pick someone to fire to get the Enterprise features right? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(and for those that can&#039;t tell, the absurdity of the scenarios I presented should clue you in that this is a half troll/half not)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the cloud plays a big part in it.  However, is the cloud ready for that?  I don&#039;t think so and the cost that is needed to put yourself into a cloud infrastructure is in most cases, more expensive than paying for licensing to keep things as they are (think project, consulting, project time, resources..._).  Azure isn&#039;t protected from outages completely just like anything else either.  We&#039;ve seen that even recently with the outage.  Now, for a DR solution on a high volume (size) and even distributed landscape, the cloud is an awesome solution right now.  We still have to consider support that Azure doesn&#039;t provide yet and what we have to go through simply to make us Azure ready.  Azure is secure but there are a lot of big companies out there that need to take security to a level that the term, &quot;The Cloud&quot; simply freaks them out.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In short, Yes.  I think the cloud can provide a solution in some ways to HA but mostly DR in respect to database mirroring.  Recent price changes make that even more realistic.  We still need growth and maturity in the cloud and SQL Server (IMO).  Until then, a lot of the major companies will hesitate.]]></description>
