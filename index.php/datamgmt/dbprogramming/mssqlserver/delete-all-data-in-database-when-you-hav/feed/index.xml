		<description><![CDATA[Here is my suggestion I posted in above mentioned msdn forum:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would suggest you to use above script just to generate &quot;execution&quot; script. That means, instead of exec (@cmd) use Print @cmd.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you get it, you can test if it is correct, made necessary modifications (it is faster to add few modifications manually than spend weeks/months to make &quot;generator&quot; script smart enough). Once you are satisfied test generated script on pre-production (test) database (or at least make backup of production DB before you test it on live data - although I&#039;ll highly recommend you not to test anything on live DB) and once you are sure it&#039;s good enough you can run it in production DB.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, it&#039;s easy to modify script to test and handle possible errors (use TRANSACTION and use  TRY CATCH or simple IF @@ERROR with RAISERROR).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I rarely use immediate execution of generated batch of SQL statements, and never in production. There are a lot of reasons for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although we use script without problem, it seems it has to be modified to support schema bind objects. 2nd script (ordered delete statements) will not work for self referencing tables and in this case only way is to disable that FK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately I do not have time at  the moment (at least next 2 weeks). &lt;br /&gt;

Take a look at the comments at this thread&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Looks like you have to make this script more robust]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nikola,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve tried to adapt your script for my case. I want to create a script creating several new tables (with foreign constraints, extended properties, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used the part of generating dropping FK constraints. Can you also show how to drop all extended properties as I&#039;m getting errors trying to create them if they exist?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks.]]></description>
