		<description><![CDATA[Great post!  This came up with me at work recently.  I&#039;ve never really used nvarchar datatypes before, so it was a bit of detective work required on my part to work out why my query was performing so slowly.  After a bit of trial and error I realised it was the data types that had been chosen.  Nice to see it qualified with stats.  Also, thanks for posting the sample scripts - some useful techniques in there too!&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers&lt;br /&gt;
