		<description><![CDATA[Slightly unclear still. I have a 64-bit Windows 7 machine and the Office 2013 packages are in 64-bit.
Even if I&#039;m running SSIS 2012, you&#039;re saying that the SSDT is running in 32-bit mode? If that is the case, what do I have to do?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Koen.&lt;br /&gt;
SSIS and Excel is not a good marriage. If you work with your own computer then you can fidle around with &quot;work arounds&quot; but as a consultant for a company with strict rules that might be impossible. If you only want to pull some data out from a sheet in Excel, make a small macro which saves the data as a TAB separated text file and use bulk insert or SSIS. If you want to push data (actual values) and pull out data (prognose) from the same sheet consider use VBA. With VBA you can build a &quot;front end&quot; to SQL Server with Excel. &lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I have confirmed what Stewart observed: 32-bit Office apps stop working after forcing installation of the 64-bit ACE driver. Excel is no longer able to open files after installing 64-bit ACE driver, but this can be reversed by uninstalling the 64-bit driver and reinstalling 32-bit.&lt;br /&gt;
Will evidently need to decide which tool is more important: SQL Server openrowset queries, or Excel itself.  Or bite the bullet and replace 32-bit Office with 64-bit.&lt;br /&gt;
Agree with Stewart that Microsoft could/should do better than this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Stewart: the ACE providers are a little disaster. I installed the 32-bit provider on my 64-bit machine with 64-bit Office. All worked fine as described in the blog, until I wanted to repair my office install. I got an error saying I had to uninstall the 32-bit driver first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
@jdbrauer: good to know your problem was solved!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have Office 2010 32-bit installed and I tried installing the 64-bit ACE using the /passive switch.  It installed without complaints and the 64-bit connectivity appeared to work.  HOWEVER, my 32-bit Access refused to start!  Every time I tried to open Access it would go through an Office setup configuration process and then fail to open with some sort of configuration error. :-(  As soon as I uninstalled the 64-bit ACE my Access started working again.  Not sure why this happened but it is VERY annoying that MS didn&#039;t write their 32-bit and 64-bit ACE drivers to play nice alongside each other.]]></description>
