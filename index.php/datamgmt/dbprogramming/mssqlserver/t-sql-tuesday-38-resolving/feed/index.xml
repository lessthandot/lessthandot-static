		<description><![CDATA[SSIS will use the 2GB remaining, like any other application in the OS. This is only however when SQL Server is maxing the memory out. If it only uses 4GB, the OS still has 4GB available.

Regarding buffers used: take a look at SSIS performance counters in perfmon.

Buffer size is in bytes and is indeed loaded into memory during data flow execution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Suppose my system has 8GB RAM and I have installed SQL Server 2012 on it along with the DataTools. Sql server engine uses 6GB memory. Will the SSIS uses remaning memory apart from 6GB or it uses 6GB? 
Also is there a way to count the number of buffers used and the records accomodated in each buffer and the size of the buffer?

If am not wrong buffer refers to the RAM memory?﻿]]></description>
