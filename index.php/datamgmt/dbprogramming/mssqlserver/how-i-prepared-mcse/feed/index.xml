		<description><![CDATA[Well done Koen. It&#039;s been a while but hopefully you&#039;re still monitoring these comments.

I currently work in a different IT field but want to start from the beginning and get the MCSE:BI in 2016. Since I do not have access to SQL server currently, will it be sufficient to purchase/download the developer edition for home use while studying/learning?

Does the developer edition (currently $59.95 from the Microsoft store) have everything necessary for the MCSE:BI?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Koen, I used your tips to take (and pass) 70-466 today. Don&#039;t use SSRS in my capacity, so that was the most difficult portion for me, but the 70-448 book does seem to cover mostly everything you need for that. I imagine if you develop or administrate in an SSRS environment, you&#039;d be just fine. For the tabular portion, I read your recommended book which proved invaluable.

Over all, my study tools were going through the AW2014 SSAS Mulitdimensional Tutorial, the Multidimensional SSAS and SSRS portions of the 70-448 training kit, and the BISM Tabular book you mentioned. I also had purchased Expert Cube Development with SSAS Multidimensional Models (http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Cube-Development-Multidimensional-Models/dp/1849689903), but did not get to it.

Thanks again Koen, I hope to round out the MCSE certification shortly with 70-467]]></description>
