		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have created a package with one execute sql task to return the recordset(object variable) and used in scrip task in one container(sequence) and when tried to use the same recordset in another sequence container with the same package, only the column value is filled by data adapter(the row metadata values are not filled). I checked by using the dataflow task with recordset destination the result are same.
Could someone help me in this.
Thanks,
Riju]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@phani= Visual Studio has always been a 32-bit application and it will be for the foreseeable future, at least as far as I know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you debug an SSIS package, SSDTBI will simulate a 64-bit environment, so 64-bit providers will be used. If you explicitly want to run a package in 32-bit mode, you have to set the Run64BitRuntime project property to false.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@enders= right now the project version is still 11. The SSDTBI version you download has no clue it is connecting to SQL 2014. It is not included in the SQL Server 2014 install, so it is probably not the version they will release with SQL 2014.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another way to see this is when you start a new SSAS Tabular project, the only compatability levesl are SQL 2012 and SQL 2012 SP1. 2014 is not included in the list.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HI, Thanks for the info. But I could see that SSDTBI for VS2012 is a 32 bit and not 64 bit. Is the 64 bit one released or how cold we run packages in 64bit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;
