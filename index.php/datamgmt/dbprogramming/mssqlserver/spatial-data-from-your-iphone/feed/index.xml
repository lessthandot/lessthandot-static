		<description><![CDATA[@cbetancourt: I haven&#039;t tried openheatmap.com yet, but I&#039;ll take a look at that, thanks.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe you are correct with the triangulation idea.  I haven&#039;t seen anything in terms of proof as to how it&#039;s being done though.  There were some places that were logged that I haven&#039;t visited. My other guess is that the phone might have been through these places during shipping from the manufacturer to the store(s).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@brian78: I think that&#039;s due the fact the phone is really using triangulation to determine its general location. The phone stores the cell tower locations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you tried to visualize the data with something like openheatmap.com? You&#039;ll see there are places that you haven&#039;t visited, but your phone says you have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Denis - Thanks for info on the Verizon iPhone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another thing I&#039;ve found is that the TimeStamp field can have some wierd data at times. There were a few entries in mine that had the same TimeStamp but were a good distance apart. I haven&#039;t found a good explaination for this yet.]]></description>
