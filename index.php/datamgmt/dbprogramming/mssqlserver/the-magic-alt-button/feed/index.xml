		<description><![CDATA[regarding the WHERE condition: 
As far I know it will be faster to check CHECKSUM(E.)  CHECKSUM(U.&#060;fieldlist) than to compare every single field with an OR.

Of course you could use the trick above to copy / paste the field list for both CHECKSUM functions

where checksum(
	 e.[SalesTerritoryKey]		,
	 e.[FirstName]			,
	 e.[LastName]			,
 	 ...
              )
    checksum(
	 u.[SalesTerritoryKey]		,
	 u.[FirstName]			,
	 u.[LastName]			,
 	 ...
              )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This looks like a useful tip, and I tried to follow your example but got lost at this step: &quot;First select a line after the columns while holding the Alt button. This is easy with the mouse and you donâ€™t even need a cursor position to start from. You can select literally every block you want. If you want to do this with the keyboard only, you need to tab to the position you want and then start selecting.&quot; I don&#039;t understand. If I select the rest of a line after a column name with alt, typing anything un-selects it.  I searched Youtube to try to find a video that would demonstrate, but was unsuccessful. Could you please explain this part in a little more detail?  Thank you.]]></description>
