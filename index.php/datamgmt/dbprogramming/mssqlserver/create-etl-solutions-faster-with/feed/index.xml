		<description><![CDATA[Hi Koen,
It is really a great stuff and great presentation.
For couple of days, i am unable to answer few questions on BIML scripting and why was it developed. 
Scenario : I use BIML scripting and create N number of SSIS packages (following some model like auditing, source and target connections creation) . Since my project is complex i make manual changes to business rules and update many SSIS packages. At the end of the project I realize that i got to change my auditing feature but can&#039;t use my BIML script as it will wipe out all my custom development. Thus, BIML does not suit here. 

So, what do you think about BIML on the following?
(a) Is it used just for the first time creation of packages in complex projects? 
(b) using better templates (with nice configuration, error handling) and copy paste of SSIS packages, I can achieve what BIML can.

I have not mentioned by views in detail but wanted to share what worries me about why BIML exists in 2014?

Please share your thoughts :)
