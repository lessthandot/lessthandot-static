		<description><![CDATA[I have to pull some data for mailing in health care.   I created the whole letter with the contact on for window envelopes. I&#039;m so happy to see this as well. This will save so much in manhours.  The expression was a little hairy. I don&#039;t have a degree or an impressive resume but I sure do  love this stuff.  Only took me until I was 40 yo to find that out. 

Thanks for your time with this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have my labels printing in two columns, but I can&#039;t seem to get it to go to the next row.  It prints two columns, then does two more columns at the top of the next page.  What should I check to help it to print on the next row?  I should see five rows per page, two columns, for a total of 10 labels per sheet.  Any suggestions appreciated :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all Thanks for this wonderful article, I followed your steps but I just get only one client&#039;s name on top left corner not full sheet, however when I run my query it give me top 30 clients from my table for specific site. Here is my query
  Select top 30 --distinct 
fa.new_sitename as Office,
fa.new_clientidname as Client,
fa.new_servicename,
fa.new_clientdateofbirth as DOB

from Filterednew_admission fa
where 
fa.new_sitename= &#039;Office-London&#039;

Am I missing anything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How this solution works further? i.e., if the report is deployed and opened using Report Server or Manager. Once opened in Report Manager, how to open or export using Print layout button (as I see there is no option)?]]></description>
