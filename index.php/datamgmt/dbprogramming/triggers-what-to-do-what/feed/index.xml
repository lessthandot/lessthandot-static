		<description><![CDATA[Triggers are needed, but with caution. When I started to use triggers a few years back, I burned myself with the &quot;one row at a time&quot; approach :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like your idea of a DDL trigger that adds columns if they were not included in the table definition. This might come in handy someday.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Another thing to keep in mind is : A trigger is &quot;in transaction&quot;. If the trigger fails, you whole transaction fails. &lt;br /&gt;
Nice example: simple replication trigger abuse: Trigger inserts into a linked server table. That (linked) server is being taken down or is locked for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;
You cannot insert new rows to your table ... &lt;br /&gt;
(unless you disable the trigger)&lt;br /&gt;
Case closed.]]></description>
