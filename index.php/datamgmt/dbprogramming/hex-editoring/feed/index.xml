		<description><![CDATA[Scott, of course there is no clear answer to that on the underlying cluster or heap being corrupted but in a lot of cases, yes on DBCC doing it and allow data loss.  I am really torn between even saying that though because all routes should be taken before doing that.  Hopefully anyone reading our comments will be the wiser to running REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS as a first go at recovery]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, so we know how to corrupt a nonclustered index, and fix it by dropping the Non-clustered index.  What about changing the base data?  What will DBCC do for us there?  And If we want to change the data, will we need to recalculate the CHECKSUM for the page?  or will DBCC do that on our behalf?  Will we need to say accept data loss?]]></description>
