		<description><![CDATA[One gotcha with NTILE is that NTILE(100) on a table with 150 rows puts 100 of them in buckets 1-50 and 50 in buckets 50 - 100 which significantly restricts its utility unless assured that the number of rows to buckets will always be sufficiently great for this skew to be insignificant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IMO it would be more useful if implemented as suggested here https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/761015/tsql-ntile-over-less-rows-than-integer-expression-is-not-weighted]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve used it several times.&lt;br /&gt;
It is good for statistical calculations - e.g. finding the median of a dataset.&lt;br /&gt;
Ntile(2) is much faster than select top 50 percent. And in the WF it is much easier to define the sorting and partioning (if needed).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So yes - it is very usefull from a statistical point of view ;0)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I have never used it before in production code. The only scenario I can think of is to divide a dataset in equal chunks so I can do parallel processing in SSIS. However, they have designed a component for that now (balanced data distributor) :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In such a case, I would maybe rather use a modulo function, as rows switch between groups as they pass by, instead of first all the rows from one group and then another.]]></description>
