&lt;br /&gt;
I can&#039;t seem to find any quick sources at present. The implication is not necessary what you interpreted it, and I apologize for that. Yes a filtered trace in profiler or trace will have less of an impact. You are recording less information on the GUI or in a file.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even still, a &quot;well filtered&quot; profiler session (and to a lesser degree a server side trace) is not free. Those events are still read at some level (how else could you filter duration if the code behind the profiling process didn&#039;t have the ability to know and interpret/apply the filter conditions?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have seen performance issues caused by even well intentioned and well filtered traces on boxes that were underpowered and quite busy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;&gt; All events are still going through and the filter is being applied after the tracing mechanism has read the data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m not so certain that this global statement (which implies there is no cost difference between tracing everything and tracing only a few things) is truly accurate. Could we get some sources for this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michelle..the key point is that you are a DBA and you know what you are doing...you will not move all the columns from the left to the right and hit the start trace button&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
someone might have a trace template that will look for every database, every user, batch started/completed/parsed etc etc&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then of course you got people running perfmon with cache hit/miss ration and life expectancy ate the same time  :-(&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
since 2005 we now also have the DMVs which give some good info that you could only get from perfmon and/or a trace before]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great points. You were, once again, On Point ;-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many times when traces have to be run on production as Michelle indicated. Gail just blogged about why trace/profiler is still a necessary tool. http://sqlinthewild.co.za/index.php/2009/07/10/why-the-dmvs-are-not-a-replacement-for-sql-trace/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What doesn&#039;t always have to happen is using profiler (and certainly not to a table directly). I often have to run traces and when I do I trace through a query, results to file on a drive that is not utilized for anything important.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I monitor performance during it and will sometimes even run a quick 15 - 45 second profiler trace to gauge the potential impact from what I am checking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also one point to Michelle&#039;s. I am sure she knows what I am about to say but it can be misunderstood by those reading... Your filters to filter down what profiler or trace is grabbing do nothing to minimize the impact of what you are tracing. Yes it may make the file grow less rapidly and yes it may be less data to display on a screen if using the GUI based profiler. All events are still going through and the filter is being applied after the tracing mechanism has read the data.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice article, Ted!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On Denis&#039; point, I have had to run traces on a production box before; it was necessary to track down weird performance issues.  A good DBA knows how to run a trace to minimize the impact.  Conversely, I have also seen a server become almost non-responsive because a SQL novice ran a trace for *everything*, so Ted&#039;s point is well made.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason to run traces on production can also be that, surprise!!!! there is no QA/testbed with the same amount of data.....happens all the time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must say I have never ran a trace on production after we went live with something]]></description>
