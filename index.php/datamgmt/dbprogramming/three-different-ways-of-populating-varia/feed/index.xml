That is also an option but becomes a pain in the neck to maintain because you will need to add a column every time you have to add some other configuration value]]></description>

Thanks for your comment. The reason that PIVOT doesn&#039;t need quotes (I think) is that those now become column names and are not values anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The real reason I( added the CASE query is that PIVOT is a little intimidating at first, I still have to look up the syntax every single time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reminds me of user defined functions, I had to lookup the syntax for years...of course I would just copy an existing one and modify it...made life easier...BTW  I do the same foe pivot...copy an existing one..change columns and table name and done]]></description>

Great post in showing these T-SQL alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We all have seen our share of option #1 - easy to understand and explain, but not the least number of code lines to run or maintain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pivot option (#2) is interesting (clever - I wouldn&#039;t have thought of that solution), but not necessarily my favorite - it may be harder to explain how it works to others (Pivot operator is not as commonly used as other T-SQL operators) and harder to recall how it works a year later when you have to maintain the code – depending on how often you use and stay current on this approach in different apps.  I may change my mind on this one over time, as it grows on me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I actually like the case option (#3) best, as it is easy (for me) to understand now (and I suspect in a year), fewer lines of code to maintain than option #1, usable on more versions of SQL Server (old and new), easy to expand to more parameters (only one extra line per new parameter in the same where clause set), and should be easy to explain how it works to others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From my lack of experience with the Pivot operator, I would have thought that the FOR TypeName IN ... clause in your Pivot example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FOR TypeName IN (ActiveServerName, DatabaseName, LogTableName)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
needed to have each of the three IN clause values in quotes (as would be used in a SELECT … WHERE … IN clause):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FOR TypeName IN (&#039;ActiveServerName&#039;, &#039;DatabaseName&#039;, &#039;LogTableName&#039;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in trying your example, I find that not only does your example work just fine as shown, but it will NOT work if you use quotes!  Learn something new every day!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, a good comparison and exposure to different ways of solving the same task.  Thanks again!&lt;br /&gt;
