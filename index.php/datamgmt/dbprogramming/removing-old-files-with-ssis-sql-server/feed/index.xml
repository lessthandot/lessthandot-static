		<description><![CDATA[I did the second method and it works fine but it deletes all of files. How do I prevent this from happening? I set the daysback variable but it doesn&#039;t seem to base it on that variable. It just deletes all of files in the folder. Help!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every time the loop will cycle, the filefocus variable will be used to hold the actual file that is focused on.  That is why the setting is required to set the index of 0 in the loop to the variable.  This will ensure that each file as it walks through them will obtain the file name.  Any object within the container can then access that variable to perform its own job&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the second method, we simply use teh filefocus to keep the same type of retention of the name down and allow us to fill the FileInfo so we can access all of the things we need with that given file in the directory]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This would have been more useful a few weeks ago.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like both examples and may well find a need for them in the future.  The script task, in particular, was a problem for me recently but your example helps me to see what I probably should have done.  When I have the opportunity, I&#039;ll have to play with the ForEach container...  Thanks!]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know when you get a chance to blog on the File Properties Task and File System Task. I think many more would rather go that route over starting to jump into using .NET like these methods rely on.]]></description>
