		<description><![CDATA[I developed a habit of installing servers with Latin1_General_BIN back in the days when you could gain some performance by doing so.  Over the years I&#039;ve found it&#039;s actually helped in a couple different and unexpected ways, even after the performance gain went away, so I still do it that way, although I was very glad when sql 2000 allowed for column-level collations.  One of the benefits is it forced me to learn the capitalization used for system objects and functions.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Release Notes&lt;br /&gt;
Sample Databases for Microsoft SQL Server 2005 SP2 licensed with the MS-PL license.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These installers require you to manually attach the database after installation. See the Release Notes for details.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AdventureWorksDB is the Adventure Works Cycles OLTP sample databases.&lt;br /&gt;
AdventureWorksBI is the Adventure Works Data Warehouse and Analysis Services database project.&lt;br /&gt;
AdventureWorksLT is a very simple sample database based on the Adventure Works Cycles OLTP sample database.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CI versions of some of the databases use a case-insensitive collation, as does the AdventureWorksLT sample database. The others are case-sensitive.]]></description>
