		<description><![CDATA[CLR is a good option but the memory concern is also a factor.  for this, it probably wouldn&#039;t be an issue but for thousands of executions, it could become a bottleneck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had something similar (although doing a few more complex processing) in place and had to revert back due to memory utilization.  Although I handle it in SSIS now on a job server so memory is controlled outside of the source. (another good option)&lt;br /&gt;
