		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

Good Day. 

Newbie here, and I would like to ask for assistance on our sql. 

Please help, how do we make the default tables on mssql 2008 r2 to be on alphabetical order? 

like for example:
fields on table:

name
address
id
city

when we tried to access it on different software it should display like:

address
city
id
name

Thank you and God Bless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We also use Oracle database and use Oracle-SQL-Developer as IDE which is similar to SSMS. Oracle-SQL-Developer also has feature to filter the database objects. However it has an advantage that if you apply a filer, close the tool and open it again, the filter values stay and not get cleared automatically. You manually need to clear or change it. I search whether same feature is available in SSMS but did not find any.

If anyone knows how to enable the feature or know any workaround please let me know.

Thanks in advance.
