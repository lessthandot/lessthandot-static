		<description><![CDATA[I am trying to find the median. I read your blog. I understand the concept of choosing the middle rows..But here&#039;s where I loose -  RowNum BETWEEN (CountOrders + 1)/2 AND (CountOrders + 2)/2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For 277, the count orders is 97 which is an odd number and the median will be the 98/2=49th row -  RowNum BETWEEN (49 AND 49.5)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For 275, the count orders is 86 which is an even number and the median will be the 87/2=43 and 44th rows -  RowNum BETWEEN (43.5 AND 44)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could you please let me know the logic here, not from a statistical point of view but based on the query point of view ? how come for salesID 277 the RowNum chosen is only the 49th row(RowNum BETWEEN (49 AND 49.5)), but for salesID 275, the Rownum choosen are both 43 and 44 rows(RowNum BETWEEN (43.5 AND 44)).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks]]></description>
