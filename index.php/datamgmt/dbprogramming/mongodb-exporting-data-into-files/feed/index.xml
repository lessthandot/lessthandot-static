		<description><![CDATA[Hey great post man!  One feedback, be consistent with the name of the sample database, you create it as ExportDB but the following code says ExportDb.  This gives an error that took me sometime to figure out (beginner programmer). And it might be obvious to some but I had to include &quot;./&quot; before the &quot;mongoexport&quot; command.  But this is great, thanks again.]]></description>
