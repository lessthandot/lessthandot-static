		<description><![CDATA[From now on, every time I use STOPAT, I will remember what you told me your reaction was to finding out about it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for giving me a reason to laugh when doing restores. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome post, Jes!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My personal habit is to write and run all my restore commands with NORECOVERY and put the DB recovery in a final command by itself, like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RESTORE DATABASE [DbName]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is totally a preference thing, of course, I just like having the command where the database is coming online be very explicit. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Restoring to marked transactions can be very cool, too! That would make another great blog post.]]></description>
