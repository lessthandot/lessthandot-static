		<description><![CDATA[I remember that you could insert February 30th in a timestamp column without a problem&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Found it&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do not perform full checking of dates. Check only that the month is in the range from 1 to 12 and the day is in the range from 1 to 31. This is very convenient for Web applications where you obtain year, month, and day in three different fields and you want to store exactly what the user inserted (without date validation). This mode applies to DATE and DATETIME columns. It does not apply TIMESTAMP columns, which always require a valid date.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember first using MySQL in the late 99-2000 time period. I couldn&#039;t tell you the first thing about which engine it was using, but I do remember that all I had for tools was a command line and telnet (not ssh, telnet) session. I think that helped me like phpMyADmin more given the alternative (although I also use the MySQL workbench tools on personal systems). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then again, I was an even less experienced developer at the time, so I&#039;m sure the databases I was creating were special enough regardless of the features I had available :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I know you&#039;ve been tweeting about using php to talk to MySQL, but have you tried PowerShell? I know there is a .NET driver, but I haven&#039;t tried it with .NET.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, do you only use phpMyAdmin, or do you ssh into the server and use the command line? I&#039;ve never been a fan of phpMyAdmin, but I haven&#039;t used it in years.]]></description>
