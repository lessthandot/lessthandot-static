		<description><![CDATA[itoctopus: I find SQL to be a much better representation of what I need then natural language. I could only imagine how much harder it would be to debug a statement or performance tune it if it was in natural language instead of a consistent syntax with tight constraints. I believe more choices in how to represent the same query would only cause more confusion, not less (both for the user and for the engine attempting to parse and execute the query).&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SQL is not hard - it is just poorly thought of in my opinion. The proof is those crazy joins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
15 years ago, the professor teaching me the database course at university told me that soon SQL will be replaced by &quot;Natural Language&quot;. That was back in 1998 - 2013 and still we&#039;re using good (or not so good) old SQL - the same SQL that we were using 15 years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fabien T: Thanks for the feedback. I&#039;m torn on the first one because I am also using the list of exercises as a visualization of the progress you&#039;re making, I&#039;ll think on it some more and see if I can find a way to get both. I like the visualization idea, I had considered using them in individual exercises later on, but having one for the involved tables all along would be useful. I&#039;m adding the defined regions for the text block to the list too, I need to work out how to implement it without losing too much vertical space or making it too busy, but I agree some uniformity there would help break up the big wall of text and make it easier to consume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Walter: Thanks, I have a version number in the bottom right that I stamp on from the build process, I&#039;ll add in the date as well. I&#039;ve also started using the @sqlishard twitter account to announce updates, I&#039;ll do a follow-up post shortly with more information, as several people have asked for ways to stay up to know when exercises or features are added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Philip: But if I had named it SQLisDifficult it would have been harder to type ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice article, but I am often amused by people not knowing the difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot;.  Granite might me referred to as hard and cotton wool might be referred to as soft, whereas applied mathemactics would be difficult for most 5 year olds to master.  The opposite of &quot;easy&quot; is not &quot;hard&quot;; it is &quot;difficult&quot;.  How difficult is that to remember? :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent work! I would suggest you put a date last updated somewhere on the page so we can tell how old the site is and when updates are done. Also, I don&#039;t mind the &quot;raw&quot; interface at all. All that typing is good for memory retention. Can&#039;t wait for an update to this site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice idea, and a clean/cool realisation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few more ideas/comments that come up to my mind after a few moments with your app:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1/ The menu on the could easily be hidden.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you start on an exercise, maybe you&#039;ll follow one after another, no need to have that menu in this case (maybe just a reminder that pops up to see where you are, but no need to eat a third of the screen)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2/ Let the user have a look at the model.&lt;br /&gt;
Present the user with a graph representing the model, give an overview and sample data.&lt;br /&gt;
Without a clear context, exercises become unecessary hard, and a bit too abstract.&lt;br /&gt;
A picture is worth a thousands words&lt;br /&gt;
This could also be a great opportunity to introduce data modeling, how and why we need relations between tables (eg: for users coming from excel/access who tend to put all data in a flat format)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3/ Make instruction clear.&lt;br /&gt;
The text block is a bit too uniform.&lt;br /&gt;
User needs to see clearly the 3 sections:&lt;br /&gt;
- Explanations&lt;br /&gt;
- Example&lt;br /&gt;
- Exercise&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe use some folding panels to make a clear separation (although it woulb be cool to be able to see all three at once)&lt;br /&gt;
Emphasis on the text elements that matter in the exercise summary (use bold text and/or color to highlight table names and column names, much like Zelda games)&lt;br /&gt;
Following point #2, exercises could also provide a sample of the expected result data, this could be really useful for LEFT/RIGHT joins examples (eg: for an hypotetical RIGHT JOIN exercise, show all rows resulting from the LEFT JOIN exercise, and rule out the rows that are filtered out, helps the user spot the difference, what it really does)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep up the good work, that&#039;s a nice initiative, and a useful quick start for users new to SQL&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: maybe change the name, SQL is hard indeed, but  haters gonna hate ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[chris: Thanks for the feedback :) I don&#039;t know anything about submitting to code academy, but there were a couple reasons I built this on my own such as not requiring registration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4.0 does seem to be causing a lot of problems, it has the next highest error rate after 1.0 and 1.2 (which I just modified last night). 2.6 seems to be getting a pretty high rate of success (90%), so it&#039;s lower priority to tweak at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At least for now I am not setup for taking submissions, but given the amount of feedback I&#039;ve gotten, I may setup a feedback site to accept submissions of both new SQL statements and other features like the certificate and training ideas. Still waiting for the morning coffee to brew, so I&#039;ll let that one simmer for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hadn&#039;t seen plsqlchallenge, thanks :)&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really nice. I really enjoy the codecademy stuff. Can you submit this there?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On S2.6, your use of the word &#039;plus&#039; in the question is a little confusing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On S4.0, (as an old sql guy) I can come up with lots of answers for the question that generate the right result, but it took me a while to get the &quot;right&quot; result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I assume you&#039;ve got some sort of database with questions, and answers. Here&#039;s a million $ idea for you...enable some framework where i can submit my sql questions and answers and license to companies that may want some special training over and above what you offer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with the previous suggestion, I&#039;d be happy to help devise questions and answers. I&#039;m primarily an Oracle guy, so i know there&#039;s a slightly different flavor as statements get more complex for SQL Server, MYSQL, etc. There&#039;s lots of room for growth with stored procs, functions, triggers, indexes, dba stuff...etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway i can print a &quot;Completed&quot; certificate i can show my boss or hang in my office?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you seen http://www.plsqlchallenge.com/ ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep up the good work. Let me know if you need help with any parts.]]></description>
