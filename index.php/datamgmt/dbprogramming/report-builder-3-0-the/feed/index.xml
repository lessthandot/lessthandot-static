		<description><![CDATA[Nathan - thanks for reading. No, I won&#039;t be updating these posts. I haven&#039;t worked hands-on with SSRS for some time, so I wouldn&#039;t do the topics justice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jess,&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for this nice intro to RB 3.0... I was using RB 2.0 which IMHO sucks (when compared to years of Crystal Reports practice), and I&#039;ve never really looked into BIDS report designer... which may be way more better then RB 2.0... Microsoft still has a lots of work to do, in order to bring up something on the table that is at least as good as CR X.&lt;br /&gt;
Have a great day and enjoy a cup of SB coffee :-)&lt;br /&gt;
