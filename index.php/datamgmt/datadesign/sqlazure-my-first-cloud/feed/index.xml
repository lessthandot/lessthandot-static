		<description><![CDATA[No sweat. There is so much information out there and it is scattered all over the web that it is hard to keep up with everything. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is why I created a Microsoft Access and SQL Azure Information Center for Developers http://gainingaccess.net/SQLAzure/AccessAndSQLAzureInfo.aspx. So much of the information I needed could be accessed from one location so I am gathering what I can and hopefully it will help others. But I have to work hard to keep up with the amount of new information available on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roger Jennings has an outstanding site http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/ for Windows Azure, SQL Azure and other Cloud development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The SQL Azure Daily http://paper.li/tag/SQLAzure and the Azure Daily http://paper.li/tag/azure/ are also excellent sources of information. And of course there is Twitter and Facebook.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Patrick, that looks promising. I probably should have looked around for a solution the other night, that&#039;s what I get for late night database scripting. I&#039;ll give it a try as I finish rounding out the database and start integrating an application with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great post. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I see you had problems with creating scripts that are compatible with SQL Azure. There is an easy way to Generate Scripts that are 100% compatible with SQL Azure using SSMS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In SSMS right click on your database and select Tasks &gt; Generate Scripts... When the &quot;Set Scripting Options&quot; dialog appears click the &quot;Advanced&quot; button and then for &quot;Script for the database engine type&quot; select &quot;SQL Azure Database&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following link opens a blog post that shows how it is done: http://bit.ly/kh9cC6&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

The goal of the program is to help customers targeting building solution on SQL Azure to experiment with the technology before its public release. It will also be a chance to provide the development team with detailed feedback on the federations technology before it appears in SQL Azure]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried any other services yet, no. I may consider doing so once I have enough of an application put together that I can actually do something with the data store. I was also playing around with the idea of a SQL CE vs SQL Server vs SQL Azure performance comparison, but I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll get around to that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently I&#039;m in progress on a sample application on SQL CE and Entity Framework 4 that I plan on expanding to include a non-EF data layer and connectivity to the azure DB, so maybe I&#039;ll post some results from that mish-mash.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you tried any of the other cloud services to see how much better/worse they are than Azure?   Are you going to post any performance numbers?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sounds like you are off to a good start... remember though, don&#039;t put too much in that DB of yours with a 50GB limit, SQL Azure isn&#039;t really meant to scale ;)]]></description>
