		<description><![CDATA[Good Idea, I think, that it must be a tool, like Style Cop for Visual Studio. I also think that, for SQL Server 2008, it will be good, if we&#039;ll have a set of policies (which correlate to rules of SQL Cop) and a mechanism, using which, we can easily export or enable policies due to message of SQL Cop. For example: SQL Cop show me warning message -&gt; I click on message -&gt; in context menu I check &quot;Apply policy &#039;policy_name&#039;&quot; or &quot;Enable policy &#039;policy_name&#039;&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent idea, I think everyone has thought about doing something like this at some point in their career, looks like you are actually taking it to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree that it needs to be light weight, and portable.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the thread there was a discussion about running it as an all or none, or being able to select the options to run.  I’d think that providing the ability to choose would be beneficial.  I’ve been on client sites where the table structures and indexes don’t change, yet the procedures are written by the application developers – being able to just run through either all or selected procedures while not analyzing the tables seems beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not sure, if this would fit in the scope, but a schema compare would be good. I’ve been in situations where changes were promoted form development to QA, only to bomb in production because someone short circuited the proper deployment procedures and …. Just made a small change to production….&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt; Must be easy to use and lightweight or no one will adopt it though.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
yes, I agree with that, That is why I think T-SQL or a SSMS addin would be the best bets]]></description>
