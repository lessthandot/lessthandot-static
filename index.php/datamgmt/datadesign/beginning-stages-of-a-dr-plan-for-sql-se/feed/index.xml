		<description><![CDATA[Yeah MJ, we have the same system here.  And try as I might they wont be budged on this.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My coments being that if every thing failed on this site we could just switch to a replicated of log shiped dr server.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There coments being, we if every thing failed here we would have no app servers any way, so would need to rebuild the whole thing off site any way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was asked to setup write a DR plan I reviewed the Microsoft Best Practices and wrote it up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was unprepared when the system administrators informed me that they were not interested in mirroring and instead were going to utilize SAN replication and snapshots to replicate data. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The DR site would be available by using an alias which will point to the source site (ServerName, ip_address1, subnet_1) and (ServerName, ip_address1, subnet_2).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The was the first I had ever heard of this solution.  Has anyone else had any experience like this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!  This model as served me well for a lot of years.  Always seems easier to plan on levels like this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cloud changed a lot of things with DR.  To me it&#039;s application for DR is the strong points of the cloud.  The type of data being secured makes a huge difference in the concepts but can really make for a cost advantage for DR]]></description>
