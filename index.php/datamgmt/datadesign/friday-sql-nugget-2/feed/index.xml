&lt;br /&gt;
I am a huge OneNote junkie.  This app is awesome for scribbled notes.  It works on Windows and iOS and syncs to the Microsoft cloud.  For general notes and ideas capturing I would think this might work well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thinking of your post it notes solution to design, another item, MindManager (from Mindjet software) might work.  It too works on Windows and the iPad and allows visual note taking, which might loosely allow one into SQL to build ERDs.  It brings the post-its on a whiteboard to the computer (in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are likely tools that work directly with SQL Server (Grant??) to help with these things, but not being a SQL-er very often I cant speak to them.]]></description>
