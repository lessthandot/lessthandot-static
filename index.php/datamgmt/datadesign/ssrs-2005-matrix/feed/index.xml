		<description><![CDATA[Hi,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like the article, ‚ÄúDisplay Monthly Totals going Across in SSRS 2005.‚Äù However, I am still looking for a solution to my problem. I have a report written with Reporting Services 2005 and I want to sort a date column. The columns are displayed as 09/23/2009, and when I sort, it sorts primarily by months and day and the years are mixed. I need the sort to sort me by years months and days like this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
02/12/2002&lt;br /&gt;
05/12/2004&lt;br /&gt;
01/23/2009&lt;br /&gt;
12/09/2011&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Elaine,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the comment.  Yes, I&#039;m looking for only the past 3 months&#039; worth of data.  But please note SQLDenis&#039; comment, above.  He suggests a better way of doing this with the DATEDIFF function.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, &lt;br /&gt;
I would like to ask : &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where convert(datetime,convert(varchar(10),hdr.[OrderDate],121))&gt;=CONVERT(datetime, CONVERT(varchar(10), dateadd(mm,-3,dateadd(Day,Day(@today)*-1,@today+1)), 120), 120)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
is it &quot;-3&quot; = previous 3 months ? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regards&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Both PIVOT and SSRS matrix have their place.  However, there is a reason we have reporting methods and TSQL methods.  In my own experience and something I try to relay down to everyone is, SSRS is good at doing what it is suppose to do.  This goes for any reporting solution.  TSQL is performs best doing what it does best in returning result sets and PIVOT almost crosses the line on that.  Performance of a PIVOT action vs SSRS handling the tasks it is built to do is the absolute decision that must be made.  Again, in my experience with the two, SSRS will pivot/cross tab etc.. the data given a fine tuned SQL statement behind it much faster than the PIVOT can handle.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This can also be said in regards so many of the newer functions that TSQL has added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So essentially, no, it wouldn&#039;t make more sense because it depends.  And I&#039;d put my money on SSRS outperforming PIVOT pretty much any day of the week :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Denis,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the comment !  When I removed the convert functions, the optimizer suggested creating a covering index on the OrderDate (with included columns SalesOrderID and TerritoryID), which I did.  The output of the query is the same, but I went from an Index Scan to an Index Seek.  And your code is much cleaner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
can you tell me what happens when you change your WHERE clause from this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHERE CONVERT(DATETIME,CONVERT(VARCHAR(10),hdr.[OrderDate],121))&#062;=CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), DATEADD(mm,-3,DATEADD(DAY,DAY(@today)*-1,@today+1)), 120), 120)&lt;br /&gt;
and CONVERT(DATETIME,CONVERT(VARCHAR(10),hdr.[OrderDate],121))&#060;=CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), DATEADD(mm,0,@today - DAY(@today)), 120), 120)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TO this? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHERE hdr.[OrderDate] &#062;= DATEADD(qq, DATEDIFF(qq, 0, @today)-1, 0)&lt;br /&gt;
and hdr.[OrderDate] &#060; DATEADD(qq, DATEDIFF(qq, 0, @today)+0, 0)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This way you don&#039;t need to convert the hdr.[OrderDate] column&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
to see how it works run this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DECLARE @today DATETIME&lt;br /&gt;
SET @today=&#039;2004-07-01 00:00:00.000&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT DATEADD(qq, DATEDIFF(qq, 0, @today)-1, 0) AS FirstDayOfQuarter,&lt;br /&gt;
    DATEADD(qq, DATEDIFF(qq, 0, @today)+0, 0) AS LastDayOfQuarter&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
output&lt;br /&gt;
------------&lt;br /&gt;
FirstDayOfQuarter	LastDayOfQuarter&lt;br /&gt;
2004-04-01 00:00:00	2004-07-01 00:00:00]]></description>
