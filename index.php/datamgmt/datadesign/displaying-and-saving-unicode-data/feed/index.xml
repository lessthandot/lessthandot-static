		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention, but cudos for SYS(987,.F.) should also go to Rick Strahl in http://www.west-wind.com/wconnect/WebLog/ShowEntry.blog?id=608

He&#039;s using the inverse SYS(987,.T.) to have automatic unicode to ansi conversion and you simply turn that off. SYS(3101) plays a role in conversion of data towards COM, eg ActiveX controls. You mmay try SYS(3101,0) to also turn off any conversion here.

The main point in wiring SQL Server Unicode with activex controls is NO conversion at all, just pass on the text as it is. 65001 will convert ANSI to UTF-8 and is not what you want for most activeX controls, it&#039;s only helpful when you bind to webbrowser control and to a html form in a UTF-8 encoded page.

Using CREATEBINARY() sets COM properties without conversion, so SYS(3101) is overrrriden and not in effect here.

I have to verify all of this, didn&#039;t yet test your sample, I&#039;m not entirel sure what SYS(3101) assumes as initial encoding. The final result may not need any conversion functions within sqlexec at all.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
you worte:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Luckily I found the following solution - invoke SetFocus of this control (I called it txtLanguage in my class) and then it was displayed correctly. I am not sure if my solution is the best to handle this ActiveX behavior quirks, but hey, it works.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think we found a better solution:&lt;br /&gt;
We put the ActivX Control with the name msform2_textbox and the Property visible = .f. on a VFP Container. In the INIT event of the ContainerClass we wrote the Code given at the End of the posting. Advantage: You keep Control over the Setfocus und Taborder in the form. I would appreciate a short message if the solution will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this way, thank you very much for posting your ideas. They helped us very much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
VFP Code INIT Event ContainerClass:&lt;br /&gt;
LOCAL lbVisible&lt;br /&gt;
lbVisible = THIS.VISIBLE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*-- 05.10.2012 / gb /  Attention to not remove, needed for a proper initialisation of the ActiveX TextboxControl.&lt;br /&gt;
this.Visible = .t.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WITH THIS.msform2_textbox&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
   *-- 05.10.2012 / gb / Zugriff&lt;br /&gt;
   .ENABLED = THIS.ENABLED&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   .VISIBLE = .T.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hallo Adam, we had the same problem with UNICode Data in VFP Native 2.6 Tables. We solved the Problem by encoding all UTF8/UNICODE Strings to a SingleByte String which shows the Characters up to ASCII 255 (except special Characters) in the normal way. Special Characters are converted e.g. like  x0113. Advantage: The database content can be read furthermore. To display the content in Forms runs perfekt with MSForm2 textboxes by decoding the SingleByte Strings to UTF8/Unicode. We created a container Class in VFP9 which has the same functions und properties like VFP Textbox. So we only had to change the controls on the form and everythings runs like before. I think VFP ist not dead ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Adam .. Too complicated  .. I&#039;ve spent last 10 days trying to put some unicode data with some stupid special characters like å,ö  etc ... But I have&#039;t suceed yet .....&lt;br /&gt;
And last remark  ..... :::: VFP is DEAD .Sorry but this is true ......(sorry for my bad English)&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to display some Unicode data stored in dbf fields/memo fields on a form. I&#039;m using only fox native DBF. All the examples relating to Unicode are SQL so it&#039;s complicated for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could any of you please come up with a simpler way to do this. Some simpler codes that would display a form with a textbox and with a native dbf (not SQL).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think a class/function might be a good method. After achieving that goal anyone can get used with the idea and work his way in dealing with zillions of languages in a form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we all can find a simpler solution for this; then VFP lives again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks in advance.&lt;br /&gt;
