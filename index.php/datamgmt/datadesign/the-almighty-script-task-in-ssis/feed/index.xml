		<description><![CDATA[Well personally I also prefer to use the actual intended column names instead of column0 etc. They map easier to the source as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A gotcha that we ran into recently was that we had an export that created 11 export flat files. The developer copied the flat file connections and changed the file name. So when we ran the package, each one had the same number of columns (at least he started with the one with the most columns) as the first one with no data in most of the columns. Not fun. PlLease remember when copying flat file connection to adjust for the columns you need.]]></description>
