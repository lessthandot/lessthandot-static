		<description><![CDATA[I started by BI career out in Oracle, and you are totally correct regarding aggregate navigation in Oracle&#039;s RDBMS engine. Furthermore, Oracle also had far better &quot;BI-Friendly&quot; indexing (bitmap indexes) at the turn of the century, and Oracle was FAR MORE ANSI-99 compliant with OLAP functions in the RDBMS than SQL Server.

Today, however, SSAS is a more outstanding OLAP engine--virtually top-of-the-class, along with being more cost effective for many enterprises. 

With more and more technology being pushed down to SQL Server&#039;s RDBMS engine (bitmaps, compression, star-join optimization, etc), ROLAP/Direct Query Mode/Indexed Views may start to become more widely used than they were years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have heard Oracle is pretty good at aggregates as they apparently behave like indexes: updated automatically, almost no maintenance and invisible to end users.

I might give the &quot;Mastering Data Warehouse Aggregates&quot; book a try sometime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mastering Data Warehouse Aggregates by Adamson is not bad either--albeit a little &quot;dated&quot; in doing manual aggregate navigation. Personally, I like to get an &quot;old school&quot; base because many concepts today are just riffs on the foundations set by our BI &quot;Forefathers&quot;.]]></description>
