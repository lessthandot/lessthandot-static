		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alen,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:-)  Thanks for the comments and reading &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I respectfully disagree with you on the datareader use.  I admin databases with 2000+ tables and still refuse to use it.  With just a little work ahead of things with creating roles that suite the security model, you can really make things cleaner and safer for your data.  Really the statement, ‚Äújust easier to give dbreader role‚Äù is what gets DBAs into trouble in the long run and why I would love to see it gone.  Forces the process of a true security model over the data being manged&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Think about it the next time you have a security review.  I think it would be a good move for anyone that wants to really get their data down to a managed state in which you can feel secure in who can get to what.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[we use dbreader a lot, especially on replicated copies of databases and OLTP systems. if you have a database of 300 or so tables and someone needs R/O access to 30 of them it&#039;s just easier to give dbreader role. the writer role is more controlled on master copies of the database and some tables have explicit permissions or deny delete]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I could do without xp_cmdshell *IF* there was a rock-solid wrapper for BCP, a beter version of file/folder exists, a few file commands (copy, move, delete, rename) and a directory listing tool.  OK, I know all of those can be accomplished thru CLR functions with the exception of the BCP wrapper.  But I&#039;d really like to have the BCP wrapper.  I&#039;m trying to write one but it&#039;s tough because you have to infer behavior base on running it about a million times -- oh, and you still have to shell out to run it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No hating at all for wanting to remove db_datareader and db_datawriter. Maybe it is because I am a DBA (which means I am a paranoid, pessimistic control freak)? So perhaps my judgment is clouded by my desire to control the world (well alright... maybe just the stuff that gets deployed to my servers since I have no control anywhere else... Wait.. Weird tangent, sorry)...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously though, why bother with db_datareader or db_datawriter. In this sue happy, legislate our problems away, auditable, standardized society it&#039;s time to get granular baby. Grant the rights you need to the people who need them. Nothing more. Nothing less. And let the abolition of the crutch we know of as db_datareader and db_datawriter help us on that journey!]]></description>
