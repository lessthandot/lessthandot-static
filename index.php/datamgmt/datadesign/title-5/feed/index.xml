		<description><![CDATA[That completely depends on the database at hand.  You&#039;ll have to monitor the fragmentation in order to determine the need for rebuilds or reorganization steps.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Give you an example:  I have one database that is around 100GB.  In this database I update stats for about 20 tables every 4 hours and then nightly rebuilds.  These types of work tables require very active maintenance to keep them running well but the lock scenario of course is a consideration.  Some other indexes on large archived tables and or static tables get rebuild monthly just because there is no need.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure I take it as helpful.  The best part of being around the block so many times in this field.  Although I think everyone that reads what I write knows I do so fast and really just try to get my point across.  I&#039;m not worried and never have been with grammar and such.  To be honest I don&#039;t review them much myself as I only get minutes to write them.  That&#039;s pretty obvious in that sentence you pasted.  Perhaps I should stop.  It&#039;s all out there written down by others anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[There is some excellent information in this article struggling to get out.  However, sentences like these make me question the skill of the author:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;So in that it is critical that in the position of supporting any database that you have queries running on that it is performing to the best it can be.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Fragmentation is easy to handle as long as you handle it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
;-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It would be worth your time to have the article peer reviewed by someone who could help turn it into an intelligible, understandable document.  I hope my comments come across as helpful, rather than as flamebait. I know how hard it is to collect my thoughts into a readable format.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  For some the tool is a good starting point and learning tool even if you run it just to see what covering indexing it would come up with.  After awhile of seeing what the indexes are and reading up on the options that come in them your knowledge deffinetely grows and DTA typically is replaced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks Denis :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know I have I believe only launched the  tuning advisor once (was called Index Tuning Wizard in 2000)&lt;br /&gt;
After you have enough experience you know how to cover a query and the tool is of no real use IMNSHO!]]></description>
