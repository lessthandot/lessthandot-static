		<description><![CDATA[I have used this code and it works great, BUT it does not include the actual zip code that I am entering. All the ones around it BUT the zip code itself. How can I make sure this is included in the results?. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also is it required to declare h and g as geography objects? I am not a big SQL guy. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;
Brilliant and well-explained article. Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there any particular reason why you used World Geodetic System 1984? I played around with other spatial_reference_ids and I noticed the value was different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I get this error message...  Any ideas why there is a duplicate key?&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[This worked for the US values but I tried to apply the same logic and scripts to create a proximity lookup for Canada (I used the CA.txt file) and I got an error stating that latitude had to be in the range -90 to 90.  This affects about 30% of the addresses in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;
How is this possible when the ranges are supposed to be -180 to 180?  If anyone knows why I am getting this error, please let me know.  Thank you.]]></description>
