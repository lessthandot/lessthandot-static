		<description><![CDATA[Gareth, I have seen many people relying on this &#039;functionality&#039; since in 2000 it did returned them ordered. I actually meant to say don&#039;t allow the order by clause in the view definition period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Microsoft even issued a KB article with a &#039;fix&#039; for this: FIX: When you query through a view that uses the ORDER BY clause in SQL Server 2008, the result is still returned in random order&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[You suggest getting rid of &quot;ordered views&quot;. How would you do that? A view is a virtual table, and like a table, has no order. &lt;br /&gt;
When you select from a view, you do of course get the results in a particular order, but that&#039;s not because your order by clause is being used to order the rows - it&#039;s actually just a side effect.&lt;br /&gt;
In a view you can only specify an order by clause if you are using TOP (or FOR XML). The purpose of the order by clause in this case is to specify which rows are to be included in the result set - not the order of the result set. &lt;br /&gt;
As an implementation detail, SQL server sorts the results in order to be table to return the correct rows (specified by TOP). SQL Server 2005 did this even with TOP 100%. The optimiser in 2008 is better, and sees that as all rows are being returned, there&#039;s no need for the sort.&lt;br /&gt;
If you specify TOP 99.9 percent, then presumably if your table was large, you might not be returning all of the rows - so the result set is sorted to apply the TOP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The real problem comes because order by has more than one role - sometimes it&#039;s used  to request the result set in a particular order (in which case the result set is not a relational table anymore). Elsewhere, it&#039;s used along with TOP to determine which rows to include. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CREATE  VIEW vTestSort2&lt;br /&gt;
AS&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT TOP 99.99 PERCENT  id FROM TestSort&lt;br /&gt;
ORDER BY id&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SQL Server happens to return the rows ordered by Id. This shouldn&#039;t be relied on though, any more than you should rely on the ordering of the results from:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
select distinct id from TestSort&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
