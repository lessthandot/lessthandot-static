		<description><![CDATA[About &quot;Database Files Sizes in All Databases and used space&quot;

Thank you so much. It is useful to solve my problems.
I am a beginner of SQL
Somethings I would like to ask
I create a table include each database name, used size and unused size

but I am also want to add Log Size, Data Size, Last User Update into above table. I will show the code below. There are two part that I do not know how to combine them. Could you mind to tell me the solution of combining table for including each Database Name, Used Size and Unused Size,Log Size, Data Size, Last User Update

--Create Table Part(Only database name, used size and unused size)

INNER JOIN sys.databases DB ON AF.dbid=DB.database_id) as a
&#039; from sys.databases
 
exec(@SQL)
 
select * from #Test order by DbName 
drop table #test


--Only Total Size,Data Size,Log size,Last User Update 

select c.name as Name, (c.ds+c.ls) as TotalSize, c.ds as DataSize, c.ls as Logsize, c.lu as LastUserUpdate 
from

I am looking for a script to list table names and row count when a stored procedure is executed..The list of tables i can get as below, but not the row count.

ORDER BY o.name,oo.name]]></description>
