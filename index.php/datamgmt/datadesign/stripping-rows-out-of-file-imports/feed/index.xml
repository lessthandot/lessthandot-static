		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Scott.  I asked Jamie T. to take a look.  It is very possible I am missing something obvious.  It may exist and I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the great feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this solution, but I did come up with another that does quite similar without any scripting.  I guess that means I have to get off my duff and blog about it and reference your blog.  I am glad my question inspired a blog post.  I think it would make sense to a have a robust component developed to help process flat file headers.  This would seem like a great tool for enterprise ETL.  I was hoping that there was already a tool.  Your solution is great but to it would be nice to have a configurable solution in a task.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is cool! ... I have a slight variation on the same problem, wanted to see if you have any thoughts.... The problem I have is an occasional &quot;extra&quot; cr/lf in the file which causes the line to wrap/split in unexpected places.  The problem is that the file-reader is reading a row at a time, and those rows get split... any ideas on removing &quot;extra&quot; cr/lf&#039;s (leaving the correct one at the end of the row).  (not a fixed width file... a delimited csv).]]></description>
