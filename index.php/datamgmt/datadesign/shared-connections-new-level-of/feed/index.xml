		<description><![CDATA[Hmm..thinking about that and imaging creating dozens of dynamic and completely manipulative objects that can live in a catalog and be called simply by passing the right parameters to change how they process or function.  Essentially taking a &quot;package&quot; down to an &quot;object&quot; and killing the need for multiple packages all together.  Even more, there may not even be a need for anything other than a control flow.  The control flow is the process handler and then all your shared objects are stored in a catalog such as the SSISDB where you can initialize them per the control flow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, that might not happen but I likes the sounds of it :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder what other types of objects could be made shareable at the project level? Personally I&#039;d like to have the ability to have a task or container live as a &quot;thing&quot; within the project that could then be instantiated within a package in the project. It&#039;ll never happen tho!!!!]]></description>
