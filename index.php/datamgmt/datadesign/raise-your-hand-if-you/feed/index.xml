		<description><![CDATA[And you know what was the answer I&#039;ve got after I dare to propose using log table and job approach?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;You do not know our business needs. Every delay in sending mails could cost us a lot of money, appart from going through log table to send thousands of e-mails will take unacceptable long time.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[If you absolutely needed an email, it would be better to have the trigger code create a log entry on another table, and then have a job that runs every so often which checks for new records, sends a single email notifying of all changes since the last email, and then flags those log records as emailed.  This way the data update operation could work instantly, you&#039;d still get your emails and best of all, you have a complete log of all changes that isn&#039;t stored in your inbox. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost makes you hope someone causes an update every second for a week.  In fact, Brent has a good idea for the OP. Tell them to start up a SSRS subscription with sp_start_job in the trigger, generate the report to pdf, read the report in the trigger with MORE xp_ junk and then email that! Wow, I&#039;m surprised I could even make that up &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can we please get out of the xp_ 80 comp usage already?]]></description>
