		<description><![CDATA[Assuming something like that just doesn&#039;t work.  I don&#039;t do quite as much as you do as far as a count of SQL Saturdays but do enough to know, if I have something like that (vendor or not) that it is far easier and just curtious to say, &quot;Hey, my flight leaves at 5PM so a earlier slot would be AWESOME!&quot;  Aside from that, the schedule was published ahead and changes could have been made after a quick review.  I had one speaker ask for a different time slot and gladly worked to change it for them.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact I just did this for Pensacola and now it is all set, no questions and the organizers can schedule knowing there is a early out person.  And the reason is exactly the same as you gave but I let them know.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s always important to take five minutes to just let the organizers know before mistakes are made (which really, to them it isn&#039;t a msitake with the missing knowledge).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s me responding as a speaker, not an organizer :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that scattering vendor sessions throughout the day was a miss.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While most SQL Saturday speakers are occasional speakers, most vendor speakers, like Tom, Grant, Aaron, and myself have to speak frequently.  That means we miss a lot of time with our family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking for myself, I definitely appreciate an assumed lunch time slot, or at least no responsibilities after say 1:00 pm.  This gives us (and our sales team) the flexibility to get to the airport around dinner time and possible get home in time to see the family before bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just my two cents...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[As a first time attendee, I had a great experience. I learnt more in 1 day at SQL Saturday than I have at entire week-long training courses. Plus, unlike in training classes, I got to meet so many fantastic people in my field. The volunteers &#038; organizers obviously put a HUGE amount of work into this event, and I can only say that it was worth it. I&#039;m definitely inspired to be more than an attendee next year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As an attendee: Great job. Good speakers. Everything was well laid out. I got food. I had fun. Couldn&#039;t be much better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a speaker: Not a complaint in the world. You guys packed the room, got me excellent feedback, fed me. I&#039;ll be back when and if I can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a vendor: Putting vendor sessions next to speaker sessions was probably a mistake. I had two people. It&#039;s not going to push people to want to support SQL Saturday&#039;s if they&#039;re not sure they will get people in the rooms. I&#039;d work on that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for all the hard work guys. You did good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As an attendee: the location was great. The college was easy to find and it was easy-to-navigate, but not so big I got lost finding my rooms. The breakfast and lunch were excellent. The speaker line-up was out of this world. I wish I could have been at every single session. My only complaint was the failure of the wireless access, although I know that wasn&#039;t the event organizer&#039;s fault, that was DeVry&#039;s. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a speaker: thank you for letting me speak. Also, thank you for putting me next to Brent so that when his room filled up, I got the overflow. :-) The time alloted to the sessions, and between, was perfect. I will submit again if the group does this next year. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you, Ted, for your help organizing the event. Thank you to Aaron, Norm, Bob, Bill, Wendy and all of the volunteers, too.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Phenomenal job by you and all the volunteers who put in time and effort to make this weekend a success.  I appreciate how difficult it is to host an event for 400 people.  Just a few ideas that might help make future events run smoother:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) With all the T-intersections in the building, It would be helpful to have a sign at each T saying which rooms were in which direction.  I often got confused which direction I should go (I know that&#039;s what the maps were for, but just having it right there in front of me would be a lot easier).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2) On the sign outside each door, put that room&#039;s schedule so you can see who is in that room at a glance.  Again, having these quick references on the wall saves us from having to keep digging out our maps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3) Jacki Hamilton should be exempt from future prize drawing at SQL Saturday. (Just kidding -- that was just a statistical anomaly.)  I do like the one prize per person limit, though, since if I remember correctly, someone else was a repeat winner too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again, Ted!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you asked. &lt;br /&gt;
1. There were no event evaluation forms available to fill out at the end of the program.(I guess hence this post).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. I was one of the registration desk volunteer who came at 7 am that day. I think some extra printed schedules and extra lanyards should be made available. These were some of the common requests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. I think every person who registered has the registration number and that number was on all their raffle, lunch tickets etc. I know people would not have remembered their registration number. But if we had sorted all the materials from 1 to 400 (or whatever) registration numbers and if there was a master list with that number and name then people would come to the registration desk and we ask their name as we did on the day and will see the number against their name and pull their documents from the pile ordered by number. I think this would make the process much faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. If you limit one raffle award per attendee than many other would have gotten opportunity to win something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. Session evaluation raffle should be done then and there in the class. Because I did not get tweets of the winner from all the sessions.]]></description>
