		<description><![CDATA[Not where I work  :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We generally use the latest .NET version available, since we also all have MSDN VS 2008 is no problem either&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But yeah upgrading Databases is another story...we still have servers on 2000..but After July 1st sometime (start of new fiscal year) they will be upgraded to 2008&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
we will actually upgrade one server to 2008 already on Monday 9AM (according to the ticket)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Which is more than likely true for the majority of product based companies.  upgrades and new technology cost money and IT is nothing more than a spending house when you sell a widget.  People just don&#039;t upgrade because they release a new version in that type of environment. You know that]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;Can you use LINQ and .NET 3.5 stuff in VS 2005? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Absolutely no need.  Until the business or the development team find a need there is no reason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;Also why do you think VS 2005 is better than VS 2008&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t.  Bad use of words up there.  2005 is stable and a very good development tool IMO.  I haven&#039;t had a problem with it in years.  If it works I don&#039;t try to break it ;)  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;Why wouldn&#039;t you install VS 2008? You can still target .NET 2.0 if you need to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes but I can ask the same question. Why install VS 2008? ;)]]></description>

Also why do you think VS 2005 is better than VS 2008? Are there any specific things that you can think off?]]></description>
