		<description><![CDATA[Here are a couple of things I think can help someone&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Knowledge and the ability to quickly find the solution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read, read, read, listen to podcast, setup all the good sql blogs in your RSS reader and bookmark the really good posts on delicious&lt;br /&gt;
Get involved with newsgroups, if you don&#039;t know the answers then lurk in the beginning after a while you will see that the same questions keep coming back and back, memorize those....sooner or later you will get into a similar situation and it will be nice to know the answer&lt;br /&gt;
Read all the white papers for your SQL product, watch all the webcasts/netcasts/screencasts&lt;br /&gt;
read at least a tech book a month&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
you need to have a library of scripts that you can use&lt;br /&gt;
Wizards are nice but they don&#039;t cut it especially when you have to log into sql from the command line. This is also one of the reasons I place code on the wiki here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Get some tools&lt;br /&gt;
yeah you can roll your own SQL Compare but red gate has been doing this for years and their product is more robust, faster and netter than your scripts...it is also not expensive&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Train and practice&lt;br /&gt;
make sure that you know how to do a backup and restore, i still remember a person who posted that instead of a backup she did a restore with a year old copy and destroyed the database since that was the only backup they had  :-( The advice she got was to update her resume...don&#039;t let this happen to you&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be proactive&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t wait for stuff to happen, monitor everything you can so that you know before it happens, CheckDb exists there for a reason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As long as the person grabs your hand.. ahem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excellent post and btw your reply made headway in my project and has prompted for a thorough review of how we manage our databases starting with some work tasks I have identified for said project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the above model applies to other roles as well, it&#039;s easy to be boxed into a typical profile but if you do not aspire to rise above your responsibilities and get involved with the business community you will not be heard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;Can you explain a deadlock and actually have a manager understand it? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
sure....:-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is how you do it; tell your manager to grab the phone, next you grab his hand and squeeze it real hard, now ask him to try making a phone call....he won&#039;t be able to since you are locking him...now you can&#039;t use the phone because your manager has it, your manager can&#039;t use it unless you release his hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BTW this actually happened to me when I asked a person to explain a deadlock to me and he told me to grab the phone, he then proceeded to grab my hand&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, he did not get the job]]></description>
