		<description><![CDATA[As Dan mentioned, there is a table property &lt;b&gt;NoRows&lt;/b&gt; under the &lt;b&gt;Data Category&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;Properties Window&lt;/b&gt;. It will display any message you put into the expression when there are no rows returned by the dataset. It is a much easier way of doing what has been described. I know this works in 2005, not sure about 2008 :-)&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good way to display an error message. I had previously been displaying an error message in a textox with a rectangle, and conditionally hiding it. The problem with that, even hiding the rectangle/texbox, is that the report still accounts for that space, even though the rectangle and textbox are not visible, causing your table to start being display deeper in the page. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I noticed is that the method to hide the textbox works in the Visual Studio preview pane, but the textbox shows regardless once deployed to the report server.  This is a report developed in Visual Studio 2005 deployed to SSRS 2008.  The hide method applied to the textbox works great, however.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a pretty good idea.  I think I might start implementing that.  Actually, this gives me another idea:  for certain reports which usually include a date range context and are sourced from a data warehouse (therefore being less up to date than the source system), I might include a &quot;Data current as of MM/DD/YYY&quot; snippet in addition to the No data returned text.]]></description>
