I am aware of Redgate&#039;s SQL Test.  In fact, they approached me several months ago when they requested that I re-write SQL Cop checks to include in SQL Test.  I have re-written a couple of the tests already and will finish up the rest in a couple weeks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi George,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know this comment is some time after your post, but I thought it would be worth mentioning a new beta product from Redgate called SQL Test (in case you hadn&#039;t already come across it).  This is a small plugin for SQL Management Studio that works with tSQLt and gives you a funky GUI Test runner that makes creating tSQLt and running tSQLt tests very simple.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi George, &lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the review of the class. We were glad to have you in attendance. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In response to Christiaan&#039;s comment, tSQLt can definitely be used in the build process. You can check out http://tsqlt.org/177/integrating-tsqlt-with-cruise-control/ for more information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And for SQLDenis, can you tell us more about the problem you&#039;ve experienced with #temp tables? You can either email me directly or send a message to the tSQLt Google group: https://groups.google.com/group/tsqlt&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy TDDing!&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, this was a great seminar.  The tSQLt framework makes it easier than I thought possible to use established unit testing practices for testing SQL code.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I plan to write a little more about the framework from the technical side, if you don&#039;t beat me to it :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am pretty sure that we use the same SQL unit test framework here&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe it had some issues with procs that had #temp tables but am not 100% sure&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is nice to have things like this, the more you can automate the better...I think the rule is if you have to do it more than twice script it out/automate it]]></description>
