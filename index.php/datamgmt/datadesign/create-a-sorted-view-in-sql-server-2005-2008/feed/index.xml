		<description><![CDATA[Hi - 

Thanks - I am one of those users who &quot;hit your site with a search for how to create a sorted view in SQL Server 2008&quot;  haha.  

Anyway, I used your fix, instead of select *, and here&#039;s my use case:

We have a QuickBooks server that has a 3rd party data katchangy.  The Katchangy can make odbc connections to our SQL server installation to pull data, but it has a limitation to only pull &quot;objects&quot; like tables and views.  So we created a view to use with the limited access privileges that the katchangy has on our sql server.  So, you see, we could not do a command like &quot;select * from&quot;, we are restricted to using the view.  Your solution, worked perfectly, by the way, except I selected 99.999 percent....

I could imagine this being the same situation with any number of limited access scenarios, where views are used exclusively to limit access and execution privileges.  Thank you for your very helpful post.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using a &#039;partition by ... order by&#039; clause in some views (to get the first item in subsets), and these views show up in the results pane of SQLCop. This is unexpected, because I&#039;m not sorting the end result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is this on purpose?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You comment:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I actually never understood the need for sorted views to begin with, how hard is it to do something like this...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in fact Microsoft recommends Views because them are COMPILED and so the performance are increased. For example, you must tie several tables for accomplish just one result, if you query, and query and query each time this is poor programing technique, with VIEWS SQL automatically updates the &quot;virtual&quot; table and the performance is improved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for you comment I confirms is a bug in Microsoft&#039;s SQL 2005-2008&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bye]]></description>
