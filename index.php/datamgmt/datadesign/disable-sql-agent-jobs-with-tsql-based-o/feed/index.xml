		<description><![CDATA[Instead of doing the complicated stuff of altering jobs (which I admit could be really useful), it would be a lot simpler to just store the &quot;last notified datetime&quot; in a table, and only send the notification when the current date is greater than the last notified date. That way your scheduled task can run as often as you want but only one notification per day will be sent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than using a &quot;last notified datetime&quot; it might make sense for someone to use &quot;next notify datetime&quot;. It might also make sense to work in some logic so that a new notification goes out only after the alert-condition has gone through a false phase first. (Such as, once capacity is under 1000, no new notification can be sent until it has exceeded 1000 and then dropped under again). This can be done with a simple bit column. Combined with the &quot;last notified datetime&quot; you can fine tune your IF statement all you like and not need to modify jobs.]]></description>
