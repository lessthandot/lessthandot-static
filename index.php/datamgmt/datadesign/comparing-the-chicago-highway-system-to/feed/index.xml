		<description><![CDATA[:) what else is new, money fixes everything&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the problem with highways/roads are that most of them have reached, if not overreached their designed capacity. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know the 401 in Ontario, especially Toronto segments, is 6X its designed capacity? so any minor issue will disrupt the flow significantly&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a funny read nonetheless, thanks]]></description>
