		<description><![CDATA[While the new date type largely resolves the date limits in datetime, it is often useable for much of my work. I often need to store BC dates, which is still outside of the range.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One way that I get around this is to use an offset value, but this has been the source of some difficult bugs and makes it difficult to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are there any better alternatives?&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
