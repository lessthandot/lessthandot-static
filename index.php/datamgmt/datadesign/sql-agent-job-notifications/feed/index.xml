		<description><![CDATA[In my example it differs in no way at all.  In what I tried to get across though is in most jobs you&#039;re going to have tasks that are not per say required to pass in order to complete the next tasks.  In the discussion I was bringing up there was a download task, insert task, select into report task and critical update task.  Say your report task fails but it&#039;s something that is not critical and you can run it real-time next business day but if that task fails and your job exits without the update you&#039;re in deep.  That alone can be handled with error handling in the job but you may not to be notified from the sql task that you are required to do this.  &lt;br /&gt;
basically what this gives you is free hand notifications in the coding and tasks.  It may have been missleading providing a compelte task just for sending notifications.  think of the tasks within the others&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And please don&#039;t be sorry for asking.  I am more than open to someone saying, &quot;Man this is dumb.  Just do this...&quot;  That&#039;s how we grow into better people at our jobs :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for asking&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How is this different than setting up &quot;Notifications&quot; in the &quot;Job Properties&quot; window? &lt;br /&gt;
Choices of Email/Pager/Net Send... without T-SQL code&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Provided, I think one needs to setup Database Mail for the mail server]]></description>
