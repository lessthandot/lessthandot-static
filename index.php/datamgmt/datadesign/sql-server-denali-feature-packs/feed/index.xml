&lt;br /&gt;
Oracle/Sybase charges for partitioning, compression, warehousing etc etc and list those as features&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
with SQL Server they come with a certain edition, if they charged per feature then licensing would really be a mess (it is already complicated as it is)]]></description>
