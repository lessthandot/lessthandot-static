		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I see - hopefully if one comes to Philly they&#039;ll do the same thing.  I didn&#039;t make it to code camp this year, feeling kinda bad about it.  You must&#039;ve had a good time if you&#039;re already thinking about the next version of your presentation!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like it was a good event - thanks for posting the slides.  And good work getting up there to talk.  With school finally finished, it&#039;ll be too soon if I ever have to talk in front of a group again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&#039;t know they did .net sessions at these events, the variety makes them a bit more appealing to me :)]]></description>
