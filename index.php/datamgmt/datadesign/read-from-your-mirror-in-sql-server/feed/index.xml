		<description><![CDATA[Hi on-p-n-t, &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Good article. Really! Thanks. Follow-up question :) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose I&#039;m using log shipping and because of changes in data latency requirement, I&#039;m forced to perform more frequent restores and users are of course getting kicked out while the restores are ongoing. Suppose replication isn&#039;t a viable replacement (let&#039;s say I have valid reasons that I refuse to enumerate :P). Suppose I approach as you discussed on this post, I&#039;d have to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) drop the snapshot and recreate it every X hours. During this time, the snapshot wouldn&#039;t be accessible, right? This would probably be equivalent to the users getting kicked out which I want to avoid. :( Or I can...&lt;br /&gt;
2) create a new snapshot every time and let my reporting app switch to the new snapshot once it&#039;s created. Or i can...&lt;br /&gt;
3) just keep my current log shipping setup, add a second destination...then somehow let my reporting app connect to this 2nd destination when restore is ongoing in the first one. Then switch again when done. Makes sense?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oy! Replication&#039;s starting to look &quot;prettier and prettier&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Good article but one thing to mention. When you&#039;re in a mirroring setup you don&#039;t have to purchase a new license for the mirrored instance so long as its non-active (read also: not using it for reporting purposes).
