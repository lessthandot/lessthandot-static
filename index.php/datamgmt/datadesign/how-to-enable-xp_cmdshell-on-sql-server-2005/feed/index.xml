SQL Server blocked access to STATEMENT ‘OpenRowset/OpenDatasource’ of component ‘Ad Hoc Distributed Queries’ because this component is turned off as part of the security configuration for this server. A system administrator can enable the use of ‘Ad Hoc Distributed Queries’ by using sp_configure. For more information about enabling ‘Ad Hoc Distributed Queries’, see “Surface Area Configuration” in SQL Server Books Online. ”&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[This was great I&#039;m and Engineer, not a DBA, that works with Control systems. We are cutting cost by using 2008 express as 10GB is more than enough for Data Storage. Since Surface Area Configurator (What ever the Hell that is) is not with Express I was glad to find the info to set XP_cmd and ad Hoc. Thank you very much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have just installed SQL 2008 on my new machine after using SQL 2005 on my old one. I was trying to connect to a remote instance of 2005 on another server from my new 2008 instance and it was erroring as you described, even though &quot;Allow Remote Connections to this server&quot; was checked on my instance properties. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ran your script and now it&#039;s working fine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers]]></description>
