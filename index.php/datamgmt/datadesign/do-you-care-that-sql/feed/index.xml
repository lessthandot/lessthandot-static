&lt;br /&gt;
For small group of developers, this is not a problem at all because you can upgrade your system without having to exert so much effort in convincing the management to release you the budget. But what if there +50 developers? That would cost a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a different perspective. We are not a development shop. We have dozens of applications provided by vendors, all of which use different versions of SQL Server. This is completely separate from the corporate decision of which operating system to use on our desktop machines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, while there is no problem in running the server portions of Denali on one of the listed supported operating systems, it would be a real problem (to me) if the client tools will not run on XP. There is no linkage there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s unreasonable to say that &quot;because we&#039;re using the latest and greatest DBMS we ought to change our desktop OS too.&quot; Getting a new operating system in just IT is problematic because it is here that we do all our testing, plus this really complicates support to have multiple OSes throughout the organization. Upgrading all the machines from XP would be problematic too: there is a huge cost to changing thousands of computers to a new OS, testing for and dealing with compatibility problems for dozens of important applications, and taking the hit of user confusion and lack of competency with the new OS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to address a couple of points quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Jonathan, about legacy application support - do you mean you have legacy apps that use SQL Server and that only run on XP but that you suddenly will need to upgrade to use Denali? Or that you want to run both your XP legacy apps and Denali on the same OS? The answer to the former is that you simply don&#039;t migrate the app to Denali, or ask the vendor why the double standard. For the latter, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(2) David, unless you are actually showing demonstrations of Denali functionality, why do you need Denali for these demonstrations on your VMs? Realistically, when do you plan to start doing this? On the day of release? How much longer do you expect to be able to get by with XP? What are you pain points with XP mode? It seems like you&#039;re going to need to make some trade-offs at some point... this may mean either using Win7 in a slightly larger VM, or putting off Denali...]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
As far as VMs for demos, I believe Denali will run on Windows Core server, so that should keep your footprint small.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Honestly, other than a few desktop apps that install local copies of express edition, this only effects developers. Moving developers to Windows 7 in even the most conservative of IT orgs is not a big deal, and a good stepping stone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan in regards to &quot;Legacy applications are the only reason not to go to Windows 7&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is what XP mode is for  :-) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I still thing, do what Apple does, just don&#039;t support it and be done with it&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t there kind of a paradox when someone looks for the very last version of sql server despites he does run such an old version of windows ? It&#039;s like choosing the best babolat balls while you play with your grandpa&#039;s wood racket.&lt;br /&gt;

I wonder who could face a roablock here...]]></description>
