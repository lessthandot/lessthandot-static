&lt;br /&gt;
If your ever in the NYC/Long Island area, let me know if you want to speak at a user group. I attend a few and used to run LIPHP. I don&#039;t think we have any SQL Server user groups, but I&#039;m sure you could speak on topics of interest to the .NET groups.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jes,&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ll be very surprised if you don&#039;t manage to succeed on every front this year. You&#039;re already accomplishing the &quot;help others&quot; goal; reading your list has forced to to do one of my own. And, your adventures in cooking have made me decide to learn how myself. I&#039;m tired of reading about what you&#039;re pulling out of the slow cooker while I&#039;m microwaving something or slapping some lunch meat on bread. It&#039;ll probably make my Dr. happy too when he checks my cholesterol and blood sugar level.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See ya at SQLSAT in East Iowa again and in Chicago. Stacy will be in Chicago, he&#039;s going to work for Microsoft in January, and maybe we can get Jason, Kendra and the rest of the group from SQLSAT 50 to go out again. I haven&#039;t had so much fun in years. And I still intend the write that blog post on &quot;How many DBA&#039;s does it take to find a bar.&quot;]]></description>
