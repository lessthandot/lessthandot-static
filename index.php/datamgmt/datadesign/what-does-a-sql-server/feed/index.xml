		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Windowing functions and CTEs &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
windowing/ranking functions are RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() and NTILE()&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189798.aspx&quot;&gt;example from Books On line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;USE AdventureWorks2008R2;&lt;br /&gt;
GO&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName&lt;br /&gt;
    ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY a.PostalCode) AS &#039;Row Number&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
    ,RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a.PostalCode) AS &#039;Rank&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
    ,DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a.PostalCode) AS &#039;Dense Rank&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
    ,NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY a.PostalCode) AS &#039;Quartile&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
    ,s.SalesYTD, a.PostalCode&lt;br /&gt;

WHERE TerritoryID IS NOT NULL &lt;br /&gt;
    AND SalesYTD &lt;&gt; 0;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 a CTE (Common Table Expression) looks like this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
;WITH CTE AS (SELECT * FROM sysobjects) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT * FROM CTE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is an example from &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766.aspx&quot;&gt;Books On Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;USE AdventureWorks2008R2;&lt;br /&gt;
GO&lt;br /&gt;
-- Define the CTE expression name and column list.&lt;br /&gt;
WITH Sales_CTE (SalesPersonID, SalesOrderID, SalesYear)&lt;br /&gt;
AS&lt;br /&gt;
-- Define the CTE query.&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;br /&gt;
    SELECT SalesPersonID, SalesOrderID, YEAR(OrderDate) AS SalesYear&lt;br /&gt;
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader&lt;br /&gt;
    WHERE SalesPersonID IS NOT NULL&lt;br /&gt;
)&lt;br /&gt;
-- Define the outer query referencing the CTE name.&lt;br /&gt;
SELECT SalesPersonID, COUNT(SalesOrderID) AS TotalSales, SalesYear&lt;br /&gt;
FROM Sales_CTE&lt;br /&gt;
GROUP BY SalesYear, SalesPersonID&lt;br /&gt;
ORDER BY SalesPersonID, SalesYear;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Deadlock, how to detect and how to avoid them (this is a DBA concern at my current location - if I am involved, it is in trying to troubleshoot it and figure out how best to fix but I&#039;d never even come across deadlocks until recently)&lt;br /&gt;
Windowing functions and CTEs (not even sure what this is)&lt;br /&gt;
Isolation levels (not sure about this either)&lt;br /&gt;
Advanced data modeling, cascade delete. (what is your definition of &quot;advanced&quot;?)&lt;br /&gt;
Linked servers&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Advanced indexing (again, &quot;advanced&quot;?)&lt;br /&gt;
Partitioned functions (what is this?)&lt;br /&gt;
Using Dynamic Management Views to tune your application (?)&lt;br /&gt;
Indexed Views and the use of NOEXPAND in standard edition (?)&lt;br /&gt;
Concurrency and locking (?)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of my thoughts on this probably emanate from my own ignorance but are these really &quot;SQL developer&quot; things or stuff that could go either way?  I guess that the definition of a SQL developer is somewhat fluid depending upon the circumstances.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my opinion a DB developer can&#039;t really be an expert unless he could also do a DBA&#039;s job in a pinch, or at least have a good handle on what he would need to learn to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At my work I usually push things like linked servers and permissions problems and database backups to the DBA. But not always... sometimes I am doing something small or quick or on my Dev server that the DBA doesn&#039;t touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine a mechanic who didn&#039;t know how to drive a car, or a racecar driver who knew nothing about engines. This wouldn&#039;t stop either one from being pretty good at his job, but he could never be dynamite at what he does without at least some cross-discipline knowledge. Interestingly, it seems to me that it is troubleshooting time that this knowledge really is valuable, not when everything is humming along smoothly.]]></description>

which specific things from the mid to expert range do you think is a DBA task. Setting up linked servers is but as a developer you should know that too.

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder a little about your idea of a SQL Server developer.  Some of those things (especially in the mid to expert range) seem like things that I have seen/heard of DBA&#039;s doing, not necessarily developers.  But then again, much of my experience is as a &quot;developer&quot; who happens to also work with databases - there has not been specificity to a given paradigm.  So would the same hold for someone who has done database programming without necessarily working solely with db programming?  (With my experience, I would rank as a beginner with some intermediate skills even though I&#039;ve ~5 years experience with SQL Server.)]]></description>
