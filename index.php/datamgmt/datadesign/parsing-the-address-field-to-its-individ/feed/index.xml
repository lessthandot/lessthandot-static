		<description><![CDATA[This is a neat trick, but once you get past small lists (say 50k addresses or so) I think you&#039;d find it too rigid.  Even when data comes &quot;scrubbed&quot; from vendors, you&#039;ll see edge cases that really get you scratching your head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve used Melissa Data products before, but found them a bit slow, and their automation options at the time cost more than we could afford.  Ended up using a product from a company called Satori that offered what we thought was a better API for .NET applications (and at a price point we were more comfortable with).  If you&#039;re doing any substantial amount of address processing, these things are definitely worth it.  Not only will they more reliably parse out components, they will also fix incorrect zip codes and cities (within reason).  We actually found it difficult to throw something at Satori or Melissa products that they couldn&#039;t make an educated guess on.]]></description>
