		<description><![CDATA[I have noticed that customers sometimes don&#039;t know really what they want but they do know what they don&#039;t want. This is very important to understand..and if you have an Agile process in place where you deliver something every 2 weeks instead of every 6 months it will save you a lot of time and you will get feedback faster...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is also easier to test a system like that..for example the first deliverable is a login system...well all you have to do is test that, your next deliverable is the ability to view reports...all you have to do is then focus on that..this is also easier for the customer since they don&#039;t have to spend hours trying to navigate the app.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you deliver in bits and pieces they will be intimate familiar with the whole system when it is delivered because they already know all the individual pieces&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
