		<description><![CDATA[Thank you. This post is very helpful. In your opinion, what is the benefit of schemas over having a database for sales and a database for marketing? You would be able to keep tables organized and achieve the same permission control. I appologize for my ignorance I would just rather switch databases when I need sales data rather than prefacing all my tables with a specific schema unless I am missing something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again!]]></description>
