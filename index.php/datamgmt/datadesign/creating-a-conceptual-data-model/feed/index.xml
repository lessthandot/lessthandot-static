		<description><![CDATA[Oh, now you want me to give away all my secrets ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To be honest, I like minimal. Generally I use whiteboards (sometimes even post-it notes) for the conceptual model and document in-process and finished [for now] results in Visio or SmartDraw. For the logical model, I tend to use Visio/SmartDraw in a more active manner (I find it hard to work at less than 11&quot; x 17&quot;), though even then I will sometimes slip back to a whiteboard to work. For the physical I am usually right in a dummy database in SSMS building out the physical version of the logical diagrams, trying things out, etc. Keeping my tools simple doesn&#039;t give me all the extras something like ERwin provides, but it does force me to focus very carefully on the intent of the diagram or model and to keep it as clean and minimal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Plus this same set of tools is helpful if I am doing software architecture, diagramming business processes, decomposing a set of systems, etc)]]></description>
