		<description><![CDATA[The funny thing is, the line of questioning on Indexing is kind of subjective and I&#039;d probably have a field day with them on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
e.g.&lt;br /&gt;
Are clustered index scans beneficial to an execution plan?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and then ask&lt;br /&gt;
Are there any performance issues with having a lot of indexes on a table?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, you can&#039;t answer the first question on if it is beneficial or not unless you have a description of a lot of variables to the equation.  The second is a common question but again, depends on how it is being asked.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After writing a few tests for companies that provide interview questions, I&#039;ve realized how important it is to be critical of the details when asking them.  It was one reason I liked the company I moved to.  They asked the questions the right way when &quot;I&quot; interviewed them.  :) cause remember, the interview process is you interviewing them as much as the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s the second time I&#039;ve seen surrogate key recently.  Is it something hard to define for some people?  Just curious.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me the interviewing process is very frustrating, I always wonder about if I am looking at the correct resume because the person on the phone doesn&#039;t match the resume at all&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am surprised you didn&#039;t ask for the difference between ROLAP, MOLAP and HOLAP&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also did a post with some SQL questions a while back, you can find it here: &lt;a href=&quot;/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/sql-server-quiz-can-you-answer-all-these&quot;&gt;SQL Server Quiz, Can You Answer All These?&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
