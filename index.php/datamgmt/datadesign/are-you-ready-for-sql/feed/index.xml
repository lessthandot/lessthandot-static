		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised that there are people out there who can&#039;t whiteboard ROW_NUMBER().  There are so many places where it can be used to solve problems.  I might not be able to explain everything new in 2008 &#038; R2, but I know  most of it.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do try to keep up, but honestly I learn/retain what I need to get my job done on a daily basis.  I really on get surface knowledge of the newer technologies so I can try to understand situations where they would be helpful so I can intelligently present valid upgrade reasons to the boss.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Top talent is one thing..having 10 years experience but not be able to write a group by..having count(*) query is another thing&lt;br /&gt;
or not know what the biggest number you can store in decimal(6,5) is just something a developer with 2 years experience should know&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ask people when they can&#039;t do a truncate and you will get all kind of creative answers&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Difference between UNION and UNION ALL is another question where the answers are very very surprising]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see a lot of people complaining about the quality of candidates coming in for interviews. At the same time, I see a lot job offerings that are not geared to finding the top talent. Everyone seems to want to hire top talent, but nobody wants to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;

If you&#039;re paying bottom tier or middle tier rates, you&#039;re only going to get bottom tier or middle tier candidates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rob, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
thanks for the comment...what you are saying is true..that is also why I will cover stuff that was added in 2005 and 2008 only. I see database on 2008 and they are still inserting into a temp table with an identity column or are doing a running count to get a row number, why not use ROW_NUMBER() instead? That is what I am focusing on with these posts...bringing the code up to 2005 and 2008 level from 2000 and earlier. I won&#039;t really cover any 2012 stuff or I might just mention it at the end and show a small example of how it is done in 2012...OFFSET for paging instead of ROW_NUMBER() is such an example&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m excited about SQL Server 2012 just as much as the next guy... but good time management also tells me it is still quite a few months away from being a purchasable product.  With that in mind, I&#039;m focusing on learning real products until the actual product launch gets closer.... or set for that matter.]]></description>
