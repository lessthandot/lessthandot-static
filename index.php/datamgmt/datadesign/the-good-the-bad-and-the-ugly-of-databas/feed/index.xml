		<description><![CDATA[G&#039;day onpnt, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for interesting article - I had experience with HORROR DB story:&lt;br /&gt;
- primary key in one table consists of 5 (!) fields, two of them dates (suppose to represent a date range, second date is NULLable to highlight the fact that this is a current period);&lt;br /&gt;
- other tables that suppose to reference a table above sometimes have 3 or 4 fields that suppose to match PK in first table;&lt;br /&gt;
- No referential integrity existed whatsoever. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All my attempts to get message to management and Date Architect had been met with BLANK facial expression and answer &quot;We are running a profitable business for last 15 years. And who do you think you are to tell a that our data is wrong&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What we did: &lt;br /&gt;
- provided 20+ SQL queries that highlighted the most obvious data issues with explanations what does it translates in business terms and impact in dozen of thousand of BAD records (after that our client spent 6 month to clean operational data);&lt;br /&gt;
- created a VALIDATION layer that performs sanity data check on ...reading data from DB (X-files message - trust NO ONE).&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t just blame outside packages.&lt;br /&gt;
I worked as a DBA, a group asked for help with the system they were developing.&lt;br /&gt;
They had not had any DBA involvement to date, they were an &quot;elite&quot; team, above the rules everyone else developed with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So their system had fields called &quot;Data&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Number&quot; to name a few, you can extrapolate what the rest of the DB looked like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After attempting to work with them to improve the design, fighting with them, even bringing it up to their CIO (we had 2) who I had much respect for.  I gave up and helped the as best as I could.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a final note 6 months before implementation, before development was even finished / stable, they ordered low 6 figures worth of hardware and software to cluster their SQL server etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Remember &#039;before development was even finished / stable&#039;, as it turned out they were never able to get their system to work, it was scaled down drastically and the clustered systems ordered were never fully utilized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was effectively an offline system that ran overnite, so I never was able to get a good answer why they needed to cluster them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But they were an &#039;Elite&#039; team.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a dba. I&#039;m a programmer. I&#039;ve got about 6 years experience. To put that into perspective, I would have cringed at this design after my first 8 months out of college. I had worked with a database that wasn&#039;t close to normalized. Foreign key&#039;s matched on differing names and weren&#039;t numeric a lot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve actually worked on projects where the tables really were a series of charA, charB, intA, intB, dateA, dateB, on and on. It was a nightmare as we had to magically just know about what data was intended to be stored in what field. Maybe that should be called Copperfield Programming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*cringe*&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe a solution to get management to understand is to write up a fake cost sheet for the project, give it to them, let them sweat for a day or two, and then fix it by showing how much less it is by putting in some forethought and, maybe, some more money into it up front.]]></description>

What an inherently inept structure. I can&#039;t even fathom how someone could &#039;design&#039; something that ugly. (Bring in the &#039;Man with no name&#039; to finish it off.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sqlsister: &quot;Third, they think they don&#039;t need to hire database specialists and rely on applications programmers to design the databases.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hit the nail on the head, this is the most likely cause of what you are seeing with that database and not always a failing of the database engine (but can be a factor).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The developers have very little experience, time or the required resource (DBA, someone other than a coder) in-house to deal with issues like good database design (A copy of &#039;Database Design For Mere Mortals&#039; on a desk wouldn&#039;t hurt) and data normalisation.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[There is a huge rift between development and management. Management, because it can&#039;t SEE the cost on a balance sheet, ignores the costs of bad design.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IT and development, because it doesn&#039;t understand how to speak to management in terms that management will get excited about, accepts the quick fix it&#039;s ordered to implement. Or perhaps IT doesn&#039;t even know what sensible technology practices are--and management is just as ignorant as before so doesn&#039;t correct this problem with proper hiring and training practices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fact is that bad design incurs ongoing and likely increasing costs for the entire lifetime of the product. The choice as development progresses is between repeatedly paying down the run-up redesign debt through carefully-chosen continuous refactoring (the part management doesn&#039;t want to spend one cent on) or eventually either ending up with an unfixable system with huge hidden costs, or plunking down far more money than it otherwise would have taken to fix the system or design a new one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s so sickening to see the garbage in these enterprise-level application databases that cost millions of dollars.]]></description>
