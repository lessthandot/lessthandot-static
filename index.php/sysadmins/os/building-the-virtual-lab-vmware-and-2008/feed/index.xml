		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t had an opportunity to try 3.6.8 with the console yet, I&#039;ll have to try that this weekend. In the next post (/index.php/All/?p=840) I used this basic image to create the database server. I have others I intend to do as well, it&#039;s just a matter of balancing doing more installations with the desire to do some intermediate and advanced level posts and posting on non-virtual lab topics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Firefox 3.6 is documented as not working with the console viewer right now&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any word about 3.6.8? Noticed this was posted on 5/11 (today is 7/27).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;In coming weeks we will use this basic image to create more systems...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can&#039;t find any follow-ons to this entry. Am I missing them, or are they still in progress? Thanks for the great post - we&#039;re migrating to Win7 and this is exactly the kind of info I&#039;m looking for!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The cost is a tricky one. The total hardware cost is spread across multiple years, as I started with my latest gaming system which in turn started with an existing monitor, case, and power supply.&lt;br /&gt;
The motherboard, CPU, memory, and hard drives total to something in the $1200 range. The case and PSU are probably in the $250 range. Graphics card was pretty expensive when I purchased it and still above $200, but you don&#039;t really need anything too powerful for a virtual lab.&lt;br /&gt;
One thing I considered doing was upgrading the power supply to a more powerful unit and buying an SSD (or 2) to install my primary OS on, but I can&#039;t complain - even with one mismatched SATA 1 drive (that&#039;s a whole different story) in my RAID 10 volume I&#039;m getting a 5.9 for windows experience (5.9 on storage, 7.4+ on everything else).&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is useful! Thanks! Quick question. I&#039;m sure it varies but how much would the hardware &#039;approximately&#039; cost based on the setup you used in this article? Just want to get an idea if the purchase has any chance of getting approved by the finance committee at home ;)]]></description>
