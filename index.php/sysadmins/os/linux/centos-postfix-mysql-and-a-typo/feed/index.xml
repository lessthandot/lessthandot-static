Glad to hear it helped Asai - I doubt we are alone in this type of problem, it&#039;s easy to mistype or forget which package variant or dependencies are installed :-)]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
The include/exclude pkgs tells yum not to look for updates with the pattern specified, so you can basically only get updates from your preferred repo(s).  When it updates, I believe it looks for the latest version across all repos that you allow to look for that pattern.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for versions, it updated to 2.3.3-2.1 from 2.3.3-2 , so it thought it was getting the latest version - unfortunately the standard centos version doesn&#039;t come with mysql support compiled in, so you either have to go to the centosplus repo or build from source and set the flags etc.  So, in this instance Updates repo had a higher version than the centosplus (which I believe takes a bit longer to come out as the base version would need recompiling with mysql support).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It would be great if centos would just compile in mysql support in the standard package.. it would save a lot of hassle for people - especially when you first install postfix.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I think i did something similar. If you don&#039;t have the exclude or include package stuff, will an updates package still install on top of a package installed from the centosplus repos? Also, isn&#039;t the plus repos always ahead in version numbers than the updates one? Did updates go as high as centosplus and that&#039;s why my mysql support stopped working?]]></description>
