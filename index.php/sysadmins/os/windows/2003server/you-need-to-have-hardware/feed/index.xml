		<description><![CDATA[OK. GOOD NEWS GUYS. SPREAD THE WORD. The issue is resolved. For people who have enabled Virtualization in their BIOS, but still are getting the 0x00000 error, there is one and only one solution. I promise it works. Its a small edit in a file that you need to do. I can&#039;t disclose it here, people can email me at dheerajpoojari@yahoo.com for resolutions.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Has anyone had an issue on Virtual Box where you&#039;re only able to click on certain icons? For example, I can launch the control panel or desktop with a single click but when I try the IE tile it just moves and nothing happens. I can go to the desktop and launch IE without issue. Not sure what to try….&lt;br /&gt;
