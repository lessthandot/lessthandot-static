		<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr SQLDenis,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately Conficker seems to be able to subvert the automatic update process to its own purposes and there&#039;s a battle royal between Redmond and US CERT about whether to switch it off or not.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s not for me to judge that outcome, but if it turns out it&#039;s neceassry to turn off Autoupdate there&#039;s going to have to be a lot of manual work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate any sensible person will want to patch their machine, but why not start out with one that does not need to be patched in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you use Linux, you&#039;ll never have to patch, because if you choose correctly, one like Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex, it&#039;s done for you automatically, and it&#039;s easier than Windows to install and FREE!]]></description>
