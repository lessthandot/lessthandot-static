		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jes,

I am the co-coordinator for the Inaugural PowerShell cruise (poshcruise.org) June 18th - 25th.  We are trying to gauge attendance. Would you mind giving us a &quot;ballpark&quot; idea of how many attendees/speakers there were at any of the SQL Cruises?   From a planning perspective, it would be helpful to know 

Thanks,

Jeff]]></description>
