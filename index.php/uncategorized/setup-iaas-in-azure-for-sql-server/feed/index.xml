I was unable to connect to the listener from any machines in the save cloud service.  it has to be in a defferent one.  to test this i needed to create a new machine in a different service.  it worked.  This means any web servers etc need to be in a different cloud service.  Took a long time to find somthing simple out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Thanks for the article.  Very informative.  I cam accross it having struggled with the MS Listener Tutorial.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn425027.aspx

I have tried running your script and am still having the same problems.  I was wondering if you have any suggestions.

I am only able to connect to the listener from the Primary server in the availability group.  I took not you said it was not possible to connect from the secondary node.  

I tried from a web server and was able to connect either.  Windows FWALL off all sql network protocols enabled.

If it helps there are no dependencies listed under the listener IP.  is this correct?

Thanks for any suggestions.
