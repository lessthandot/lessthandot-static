		<description><![CDATA[Cool, glad you liked that video! Coming up with those examples was fun. 

The 70-461 is going to be a lot of hands-on, practical use of T-SQL. How I practiced for it: I looked up each of the topics covered (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-461.aspx). I used a test database or two (AdventureWorks is always an option) to test everything on that list. I wrote queries with OVER clauses, I parsed XML, I created functions. I used Books Online as a starting point, and searched for other examples when necessary. Because I put in the time learning how to use the commands, I passed on my second attempt!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jes!

Sorry to be a little off topic, but I was referred by your old employer Brent Ozar Unlimited, to contact you on this blog.

You did a superb job with explaining execution plans and the different physical joins as listed at the following youtube link!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-jjgZ51_Sw

I am a data analyst and currently studying to pass the 70 461 microsoft exam.

If you don’t mind, please free to email me directly if you have any advice suggestions about the 70 461 exam.

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is pretty pathetic to say it is clumsy and childish to use drag and drop given that it does not require you to remember CLI commands that you otherwise would never use.

Also how does this compare to the Windows copy function in 8.1 and 10?
In 8.1/10 (well to be honest can&#039;t remember on 8.1, but definitely 10) you can pause a copy, it shows progress in terms of number of files and amount of data left to copy. If you start another copy it is shown in the same copy dialog as opposed to a separate one. A lot of this sounds like what Robocopy does but in the much more intuitive &quot;childish&quot; drag/drop way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s clumsy. It’s childish. It uses memory on the server.&quot;

Copy and paste/ drag and drop is a core function within Windows and many other operating systems.  There is nothing clumsy or childish about it.  It&#039;s great tool, whether the object your are working with is text or files.  Using memory on the server?  Really?  Everything you do on a server requires memory, including your suggested alternative, Robocopy.

It really comes down to the right tool for the job.  A one time copy task of file(s) of a few megabytes is perfectly fine.  However, it would be poor if this is a task that will be needed to be repeated over and over.  It would also be poor for copying files a 100 meg file.

Robocopy is not always the best tool either.  For copying files it is a good tool.  If you need to synchronize files, Robocopy is cumbersome.  Due to the complexity of the parameters, there is a high chance that you will not get it right.  There are better tools than Robocopy for synchronizing files.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a great util, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend running it on your prod SQL servers. It can suck up resources and take a box down. I&#039;ve seen it happen a dozen times. Great for small files or folders, but be wary with large ones. Once the copy buffer fills...look out.
/IPG settings can help with this to an extent (for network copies), but is by no means a fix

It&#039;s worth reading http://blogs.msdn.com/b/granth/archive/2010/05/10/how-to-copy-very-large-files-across-a-slow-or-unreliable-network.aspx for more information on buffered vs unbuffered file copies.]]></description>
