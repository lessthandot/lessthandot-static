Slightly more seriously, there are some good automated UI services out there, I just don&#039;t know how many are pursuing deeper checks like the ones above. I have definitely seen a few doing various levels of image comparison against prior runs and between different browsers and I think I saw one or two doing named images so you could download them. You will see some that get carried away with telling you how awesome their technology for interacting with the browser is (cool story, tell me about the features), but they also have some interesting features the others don&#039;t. When I did the broader market research last summer, there were only 20 or less hosted services out there (including a couple like Rainforest that are human powered, not including the &quot;AI will figure out how to test your sites magically&quot; one that appeared to be inactive), so the right ste of google terms (&quot;saas automated testing?&quot;) may be able to narrow it down to a few.]]></description>
