		<description><![CDATA[In companies which have rules about training, and in addition to the time and money equation, it is worthwile to study:
- at which date the training budget is allocated and by which date it must be utilized to justify the amounts for the next year. There are opportunity windows sometimes;
- if there are different policies about training, accomodation and travel; working with the training provider to see if your company could get billed following the rules your accounting department expects may let you attend trainings you could only dream of if you play by the book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Somehow the programmers get paid training even if it&#039;s not related (some I think had two weeks per year--seems suspicious that they might have used my week?), but not us in the admin group.  They said to send the info, which I did and then I hear nothing.  Years ago when we did training, my boss would fall asleep.  Today, the only words out of his mouth are that he wants to retire.  So, I constantly have to train him and remind him of things.

I resorted to training myself at work, which is on demand through google searching. Sometimes I buy books to try to stay up to date on the newer versions of SQL Server.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great thoughts Jes!! This is a topic very close my me as someone who has self funded herself many times...am working harder on staying up wiht pluralsight, mva etc too (I would add many ohter sites like udemy, udacity,coursera to that list). In my experience - big companies have a training budget usually, and dont have issues with it..or if you are a consultant they see some marketing value in sending you..without either of those it is pretty hard to sell a conference to smaller/medium companies esp if there are tons of others who have never gone to a training before. We got pluralsight where i work this year, i consider that a &#039;win&#039;. One step at a time, and glad i learned the lesson early that it is an investment in yourself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jes, these are fantastic ideas. I especially like the suggestion to bring training to the company. Not only does this increase one&#039;s value to the company, but could also help sway the decision toward the company paying to train the trainer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more about making time to learn. As an independent consultant I have had the ability to take education costs from my taxes. I realized many years ago that PASS Summit was a great chance to learn and with Seattle being close to Edmonton, Albert, CANADA it isn&#039;t too difficult to get to. The Canadian dollar being at least close to the US dollar exchange also made it easier but I spread the Summit cost over a number of months, early-bird conference followed by flights followed by hotel so it wasn&#039;t a big hit at once. The early-bird rate along with alumni discount brings that down even more. I knew I was learning when my fellow DBA&#039;s weren&#039;t there. 
As you remember, I went on my first SQLCruise this year and this is even more of a cost but WAS IT WORTH IT!!! I learned stuff from experts and now have both contacts and lasting friendships.

EDUCATION - make it so for yourself.
