		<description><![CDATA[Jamie - good point, It could be helpful to be able to instantiate BaseRepository, although in this case I belive I had some kind of &quot;special&quot; behavior in each implementation.  I&#039;ll have to take a look at the project next time I get the chance.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BaseRepository didn&#039;t implement IDisposable because of an oversight on my part.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both these problems come from the fact that I&#039;d already written all the Repositories as concrete classes before I realized I could even create BaseRepository, so I was kind of working backwards from that point and overlooked a few things.  Helped me get a bit more familiar with nhibernate, but at what cost? ;(  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I know IRecipeRepository doesn&#039;t add any value, but I&#039;m hopelessly addicted to interfaces.  Just knowing that someday, they might add some value, is enough for me ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glad you&#039;ve been enjoying the articles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is BaseRepository abstract? Many of your business objects won&#039;t need any additional methods. And why doesn&#039;t BaseRepository implement IDisposable instead of implementing in each concrete class as you&#039;re doing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I realize it&#039;s textbook stuff, but IRecipeRepository doesn&#039;t add any value here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m enjoying the series, good stuff.]]></description>
