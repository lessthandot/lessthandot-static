		<description><![CDATA[That sounds pretty cool Matt.  There&#039;ll be some stuff in the next post that might be helpful to you (for example, if you only wanted to react for files that processing failed for).  I think the ultimate point to this series will be to use the reactive libraries to consume some kind of pushy service as well.  After doing some UI work with them I am starting to come around on their capabilities for UI programming but I still think long running services are the killer use case.]]></description>
