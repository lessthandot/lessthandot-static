<p>As a company they always seemed a bit quirky which made me a fan (down to earth and human) but I feel a bit ripped off about Reflector.</p>
<p>It started off as a community product and has remained that way until now and sure enough a large part of that community put something back into the product development through real life use.</p>
<p>I used Reflector heavily during a recent project where I was able to disassemble a .NET library and find a bug with the application I was working on.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind them moving to a commercial model with this, as long as they keep the existing version as is.  Heck even stop the development on this version and make it free as it is currently (with the features) and then offer $35 worth of new features.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I am annoyed but I am also hoping that redgate are wise enough to add new features.</p>

I&#8217;ve become more dependent on reflector since then (mostly because of the addins, reflexil in particular) but I *hate* paying for software for my personal use.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be hoping for the mono folks to come out with an alternative.</p>
<p>OTOH, I didn&#8217;t know the pro version let you debug assemblies, that is pretty awesome.  Is it still going to cost more than $35?</p>

And when they took over they also said they were going to keep a free version of it. </p>
<p>In other words they lied to their (potential) customers, which is never a good thing. If you want someone to pay for your product you need to threat them with respect. They raised bad blood. They handled it wrong, very wrong. </p>

<p>If it started out as a $35 product, then I think people would be perfectly happy paying for it if they liked it. By taking a free product (that people had perhaps grown to depend on) and then charging for it, will surely put some people off making a purchase that they would have otherwise be prepared to make?</p>
<p>Even if one person buys it, they will have made more out of it than they did before, but it&#8217;s hard to judge whether it has done their reputation any harm or not.</p>
