		<description><![CDATA[In my cases, I operate faster with the keyboard than I do with switching back and forth with a mouse. If I tried to do everything with the mouse (select the section I want to highlight and then move the mouse over to the Highlight button on the menu item), it&#039;s more effort and just harder to do. By using the keyboard shortcut, I can use the mouse or the directional buttons on my keyboard to select the section I want and then my keyboard shortcut to perform the actual highlighting. It may not work for those who are more mouse-centric but I found it easier for me.]]></description>
