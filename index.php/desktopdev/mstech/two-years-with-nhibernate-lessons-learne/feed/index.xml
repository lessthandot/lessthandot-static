		<description><![CDATA[The last paragraph is very true. It is definitely not for every situation. Forget it if you want real world enterprise performance, but its fine for simple things. It does worry me that people using these frameworks are losing touch with how stuff really works. Sometimes I feel it is reducing the standard of applications instead of increasing because they use the tools badly but just thinking &#039;This is how you do it&#039; The performance bar just gets lowered overall.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The single session may actually work for a desktop app going to a dedicated back end (meaning no updates outside the current session).  With an embedded database this would work very well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the web app I ended up creating one session per request (if one is needed) and using structuremap to manage the cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m far from an expert on this stuff, but it is highly dependent on the nature of the application you&#039;re working on.  I&#039;ll try to expand on this later, if for nothing else but to help clarify some of my own thoughts on the question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post.  I am wondering if you could expand upon how you ended up minimizing session creation.  As a new NHibernate user, this is one of the areas that I find somewhat confusing (i.e. if you have one global session manager that allows a single session to be used everywhere, doesn&#039;t that tie up a connection to your database for the life of your application?)  Would be much appreciated if you could share the approach that you ended up with.]]></description>
