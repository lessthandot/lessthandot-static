		<description><![CDATA[Rich: OnStop is called by the underlying system when it is stopping. I&#039;ve never tried calling it myself to see what would happen. When you exit out of the Run() method, the instance automatically restarts (calling the OnStop, rebooting, calling the OnStart, calling the Run). This is intentional as part of the platform. They assume that any issue that causes the system to exit unexpectadly (ie, not through a service API call or maintenance reboot) is unintentional and automatically start the system again. This is also why you will get a constantly rebooting system if you deploy something that immediately errors in the Run method, is missing a necessary assembly, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mark: Sorry for the late reply. You probably don&#039;t need it now, but if anyone else has the same question, the page I linked has been updated to reflect the 5 minute period now and there is a link in the comments that talked about the 5 minute timeout when it still reflect 30 seconds. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.serviceruntime.roleentrypoint.onstop.aspx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it true that once OnStop is called, worker role is not completely stopped? i mean, it will recycle and restart itself? i have seen that happen during emulation on local box and in azure using trace statements.. but i did not want to believe it! nor can i find any documentation supporting that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
-Thanks&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this - it&#039;s just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you have a source for this:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Note: Early last year (2012) this was extended to 5 minutes, though it&#039;s not reflected in the documentation above.&quot;?]]></description>
