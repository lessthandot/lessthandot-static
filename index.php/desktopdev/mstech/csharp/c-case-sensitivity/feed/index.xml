		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit I&#039;m a long time VB programmer (VB 5 onwards) and I normally set OPTION COMPARE TEXT (setting BINARY only in files where needed)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The below line is TRUE with option compare text &lt;br /&gt;
    If &quot;Test&quot; = &quot;TEST&quot; then ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did not realise it affected the &quot; = &quot; operator at all.&lt;br /&gt;
I thought it only affected special VB operators such as &quot;LIKE&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This shows you how in-frequently a case sensitive comparison on strings is actually needed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, by &quot;regular equality operator&quot; i meant &quot;=&quot; (or &quot;==&quot; for C#)&lt;br /&gt;

Once you go to the actual comparison functions there are options for case-insensitive.  I wasn&#039;t sure which you were using.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The code I posted in my comments is some sample code I was using to prove my original problem, not the code from the original problem itself.  That code is significantly more complex and not as straightforward and not something I can easily post at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can&#039;t say definitively that it works the same in VB6 - only that I never encountered this issue in VB6 and am pretty sure I had to do similar comparisons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting second solution. But I&#039;m surprised you expected the original code to work. Does it really work the same in VB (in VB.NET it should not work too)?]]></description>
