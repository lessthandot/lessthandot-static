&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m glad you got something from my talk.  The little side project that spawned the talk has opened my eyes to a lot of potential projects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I liked how you brought unit testing down to earth.  How it can be used in everyone&#039;s day to day process to improve their situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was nice meeting you this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
