		<description><![CDATA[&lt;br /&gt;
ah, but what if I introduce bugs into my unit tests?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
do I then have to write unit tests to test my unit test?  after all, unit tests are just code in the end :-D&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nobody&#039;s perfect. People understand that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we find and fix all the bugs in the initial release, we won&#039;t have any content left for the service pack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a recession. Customers expect us to cut corners here and there.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I was probably writing this too fresh from having worked on the presentation notes. My mindset on the 2x vs not 2x is that neither are truly correct and that what we need to be looking at the cost/value ratio (where the cost is overall work not quantity of code).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like many things, a lot of people tend to take a black and white approach to unit testing and I think both approaches are incorrect. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve heard all of those arguments used, if perhaps more seriously than I represented them in this post. While you may connect better with the length argument, that doesn&#039;t reduce the belief people have in the others or the frequency they are raised.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve made the grammar correction you noted, Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, you did state one of the more sound objections to automated unit testing, namely that it&#039;s twice as much software, but you rather strawmanned your mocking of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The big concern with automated unit testing is that a large amount of untested test code is produced, then run (and relied upon) forever.  It&#039;s also a lot more code to maintain over the lifetime of a product.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps if you took the objection seriously, you might come up with a better answer to it, rather than giving the impression that those who enthuse about automated unit testing are dogmatic idiots.  Defeat your enemy&#039;s strongest argument, not his weakest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aside from that, when you ask &quot;Whose going to pay for all that keyboard wear?&quot;, be aware that you actually mean &quot;Who&#039;s ...&quot; (&quot;Who is ...&quot;) -- &quot;Whose&quot; is the genitive interrogatory pronoun, and means &quot;of whom&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t make mistakes so why test?&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ll write the perfect code to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a hype there will be something new next year.&lt;br /&gt;
We do waterfall.&lt;br /&gt;
We use code generation.&lt;br /&gt;
Running all these test is slow.&lt;br /&gt;
Leave me alone I&#039;m sleeping ;-).&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
