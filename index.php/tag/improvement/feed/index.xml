				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I found <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/154/index.jsp" title="More information on BBC America">Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s Kitchen Nightmares</a> on Netflix. Each episode of this show starts with a restaurant that is on the brink of collapse and follows Gordon through his efforts to help the owners turn their restaurant around. Usually I don&#8217;t enjoy reality shows, but along with the drama and swearing there are a lot of great takeaways (no pun intended) for us as IT people.</p>
<p>The five that initially occurred to me are Simplicity, Authenticity, Communications, Consistency, and Leadership. By the time I was done the post I had considerably more, but I don&#8217;t want to spoil the show for you.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m obviously in no way affiliated with Netflix, Gordon Ramsay, or the BBC and I hope that if for some reason he finds himself trawling through IT blogs he doesn&#8217;t take offense at this post. </p>
<p>I watched a few episodes of the US show and found it to be missing most of what I liked about the UK version, so if you&#8217;ve only seen the US version this whole post may confuse you.</em></p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>In many episodes we see a restaurant struggling to serve such a large variety of items that it has no chance but to do them all poorly. The kitchen has no way to be prepared, as every evening is radically different. This struggle then forces them towards false economies of purchasing pre-prepared foods, freezing in advance, and generally cutting corners just to keep up. Simplifying the menu allows the kitchen to focus, wait until that day to prepare, and operate in a smoother manner.</p>
<p>Now think about it from an IT perspective. In the IT world we have a habit of over-complicating our solutions. We see the technologies shifting in new directions, new products coming, open a book and see architectural patterns for software development, patterns for building infinitely scalable networks, and so on. We try to provide service from an infinitely large menu filled with options we have never really tried. We add functions and unrequested features as a matter of course, ignoring the complexity and extra costs these add in. </p>
<p>That approach doesn&#8217;t work in the restaurant business and it only appears to work in the IT trade because no one gets violently ill when we deliver half-cooked systems. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get to clever&#8221;. A professional chef manages the size of their menu to what they can deliver and a professional IT group has to do the same. We need to build a simpler menu that focuses on delivering what the business needs and what we can provide rather than trying to deliver anything and everything on the market (and doing all of it poorly). This doesn&#8217;t mean leaving off new technologies, but we need to make sure we&#8217;ve tried them and have a good grasp of their strengths and weaknesses before putting them on the menu.</p>
<h2>Authenticity</h2>
<p>To appeal to the customer, they have to identify with our product. In several episodes we see Ramsay polling the person on the street about menus, dishes, and once the color of the restaurant. What we end up seeing is a gap between what the customer wants or expects and what the restaurant is providing. In nearly every case, coming into better alignment with the potential customer is part of the recovery. The restaurant shifts to local produce and meats or to more authentic dishes. The menu and food changes to become more consistent with their area or it&#8217;s theme and capitalizes on the authenticity to build customers.</p>
<p>With IT, authenticity is just as important. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the server is a Dell or HP, whether the end user asks for an ERP or scheduling system, whether we prefer an MVC framework or Silverlight application. What matters is working within the context of the business and what our potential users can receive value from. We need to work with our business to determine if an ERP is the best choice or if maybe a small business finance package would be a better fit. Are we using a new framework because it benefits the users or our ego? COTS or homegrown? Does the value of a feature outweigh it&#8217;s cost? Is it a quality product or did we buy it based on the quality of the bar they took us to after that tech show?</p>
<p>Business alignment and helping the business make technical decisions is part of our authenticity as IT people. Helping the business make good, sustainable IT decisions is part of helping the authenticity of our business. Attempting to forcefeed the business solutions that satisfy our ego or laziness is not part of our job descriptions.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>Kitchens are stressful places and provide numerous places for communication to break down. The chef stops communicating to their team and in minutes the team is idle while the chef melts down trying to run things on their own. Communication between the kitchen and the floor breaks down and not only is the customer impacted, but the floor doesn&#8217;t know when to start pushing the faster dishes to ease pressure in the kitchen. Communications to the customer fails, bringing more pressure back on the floor staff, flows back into the kitchen and very quickly things spiral out of control.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s the same in IT. Not only are the communications between stakeholder and IT person critical, but we have to be aware of the other critical communications lines. Individual failures can quickly propagate inside our group and business, coming back to increase pressure when we need it the least. A good start is having a consistent method of communicating expectations and information. Without a consistent method it just turns into a room full of people generating a muddled background noise. Clear communication of delivery expectations, clear communication of expectations to the team, clear acceptance of delivery, clear updates to end users and stakeholders&#8230; These help to focus our efforts and drive repeatable behavior, trust, and a reduced level of stress. </p>
<p>Chaos is stressful and tends to feedback into itself. Clear, consistent communication keeps chaos to a minimum, ensures important information reaches the right ears, and helps keep us focused on the tasks at hand.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>A key to return business is the ability to deliver meals in a consistent manner. The consistency of the food helps set the customers expectations and build trust, while an inconsistent meal generates mistrust and is guaranteed to disappoint the customer. Part of delivering consistent food is tasting every dish before it goes out, testing each one to make sure it is up to the chef&#8217;s expectations before it reaches the customer.</p>
<p>In IT we have a habit of delivering inconsistent solutions. Applications are released that perform poorly in the real world, never having run outside of the developers machine. Networks and services are provided with no measures for quality, performance, scalability. Usability and user experience are add-ons at the end. We spend time on unnecessary features and rush the necessary ones&#8230;the list goes on. If no one is tasting the product, if we don&#8217;t have both a guide for what &#8220;good&#8221; is and test against that expectation, then we won&#8217;t be able to tell when those systems are failing to live up to our expectations. We can say they&#8217;re the best systems in the country, but it&#8217;s just wishing.</p>
<p>We need to define our expectations, test our systems against those expectations, and be consistent with our delivery. Wishing our systems are good makes all the time and energy we have put into them a waste and guarantees that we will be delivering inconsistent systems.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>No matter how many improvements he helps make in a restaurant, the critical element for Gordon is to help managers, chefs, and owners take control of their environment and lead their people. Without this final ingredient, the new behaviors will not stick and the restaurant will soon slump back into it&#8217;s former ways. With chefs he stresses the importance of leading and teaching the less experienced members of the kitchen, with house managers he might point out the same about their waitstaff. A restaurant that stands still will become dated and slowly degrade, as they start cutting corners and providing poorer service. </p>
<p>The parallel with IT should be obvious. Just as a restaurant requires leadership to keep moving forward, so does a good IT group. Without good leadership, we get in the habit of cutting corners, watching the clock, falling behind in our skills, falling out of line with the company values&#8230; Good leadership is what keeps the positives from falling into disrepair, turns groups into teams, and is the difference between a slow decline into a greasy spoon and a restaurant that delivers consistent, authentic, simple foods that delight the customer and guarantee return business.</p>
<p>There are only two directions, improving and deteriorating. No matter what improvements we make, if we don&#8217;t have good leadership in place to promote those improvements, promote the values of the business, grow and respect the team, then any attempt at improvement is likely to fall by the wayside.</p>
<h2>We May Not Work in the Kitchen&#8230;</h2>
<p>We may not work in kitchens, but we do work in environments that can be very stressful, where every customer sees themselves as a chef and outages have to be corrected at 3am. We tend to add complexity where we should be removing it, we have communications problems, we have disconnects from our &#8216;customers&#8217;, we have difficulty delivering consistently, and we treat leadership as something that is granted at the wave of a new title.  </p>
<p>I picked five elements in the show, but these are not the only parallels I saw. Management, passion, pride, respect, continuous improvement, keeping our eye on the &#8220;plot&#8221; &#8230; IT doesn&#8217;t have to invent everything from scratch. At the end of the day we are in an industry of people, delivering solutions to people, for problems that people created. All of the people-side issues exist all around us, in hundreds of different industries, we just need to step beyond our egos and be open to learning from them.</p>
<p><em>After writing this up I took my own advice to go see who else had drawn similar parallels. Here are a couple links you should head over and check out:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I was reading an article by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/05710807540870986490" title="Visit his Site">Peter Cripps</a> entitled <a href="http://softwarearchitecturezen.blogspot.com/2010/01/attributes-of-it-architect.html">&#8220;Attributes of an IT Architect&#8221;</a>. Several of his statements won my instant agreement, but one or two left me deep in thought, on the cusp of disagreement. This being a challenging state to be in while halfway into my first cup of coffee, I immediately started a second cup to fuel the train of thought and, ultimately, this post.</p>
<p>What came from that second cup was a short series of attributes that I believe all IT Departments should strive for.</p>
<h2>Attributes of an Aligned IT Department</h2>
<p>A Department reflects a combination of attributes that are an average or condensed combination of the attributes of it&#8217;s members. Aligning the group to a standard set of principles or goals can help refine or clarify the department&#8217;s identity. This definition helps the Architect determine strategy, the technical support analyst in setting priorities, the developer select training, the managers to form more effective communications, and affects any number of other roles and tasks in the department. IT Departments without alignment, or with self-serving alignment, are the ones that buy infrastructure for infrastructures sake, choose technology solely based on what worked for their prior company, and commit any number of other actions or attitudes with limited or no evaluation as to how those actions affect the larger business or occasionally even the rest of the department.</p>
<h2>Business Strategy Alignment</h2>
<p>In order for the IT department to support and help grow the information systems and business, we need to be aware of the general business vision, short and long term strategies, and driving factors that define those plans. If the business does not have a clear high-level strategy, than it is our responsibility to help the business build one, or at least recognize the need for one. </p>
<h3>Option: No Long Term Plan</h3>
<p>Without a long term plan, a vision, and a strategy for attaining the vision, the business is wasting a great deal of time, money, and effort chasing down advantages that only improve individual departments or persons. These changes often have merit, at the tactical and operational level, but ultimately mean the business groups are flying in every direction, duplicating effort, contradicting each other, and leaving the company in a perilous state. Extreme examples include inter-departmental warfare, customers that are confused or that have tricks for playing multiple representatives against each other, a high level of distrust towards upper management, and complete disregard for company wide initiatives. The IT Department is only one problem among many in this type of situation.</p>
<h3>Option: No IT Engagement</h3>
<p>IT Departments that are constantly surprised by their business, where projects bloom faster than IT can implement them, technical challenges consistently surpass the resources available to IT, or products are selected based only on what the vendor has shared without technical review&#8230;these are IT departments that are not actively engaged and aligned with the business. Just as a logistics team cannot ensure delivery to a plan they know nothing about, an IT team cannot provide implementation or feedback against technical decisions without being involved and understanding the current and future state of the business. There may be short or long range plans inside the IT department, but they find themselves constantly at odds with the business.</p>
<h3>Option: IT Engagement</h3>
<p>An engaged IT department reduces stresses across the business. Technical decisions include IT and align with the IT plan, which aligns with the larger business plans. Communications between the IT group and wider business is more smooth because the same goals and measurements are in place, providing a bridge between different areas. An engaged IT department is no longer a separate group inside the company, they are members of the company and the individuals are motivated to meet those goals, provide ideas that will further the company, and interact and collaborate with members of other departments.</p>
<h2>Learning is Critical</h2>
<p>One of the early budget items to go in hard years is the training budget. Whether this is because that budget is generally mis-applied or because people believe IT training to be for personal improvement, it doesn&#8217;t matter. At the end of the day we have decided to allow our technology to stagnate and to stop growing our options and skillsets. When the times are tight, the company with the most options is going to have a better chance at reducing costs or implementing a technology that drives improvements in the business.</p>
<p>Training budgets are not the only way to learn, but they are the first and last option provided in many IT departments. For the company that is serious about encouraging their employees to learn, a little imagination or web seaching can turn up cheaper options that allow us to continue the rowth of our employees at lower costs. Options that include weekly or monthly &#8220;Lunch and Learn&#8217;s&#8221;, webinars, even regular book report-esque assignments. The important thing is to keep growing and to keep that momentum.</p>
<h3>Option: No Training</h3>
<p>In an environment of no training, the business is at the mercy of the individual curiosities of the team. If no one is actively pursuing technological improvements, new and improved uses for current technology, or market trends, then the IT teams toolbox is going to become stagnant, focusing on skills or technologies that have been surpassed or that the market has discovered new users for that were not previously considered. As time passes, if a department is not keeping up or driving for additional knowledge and experiences, then they are steadily falling behind competitors that are taking advantage of those ideas or technologies. No one stays the best by stopping forward movement.</p>
<h3>Option: Training and Ongoing Learning</h3>
<p>In an environment that provides training and positive reinforcement of other methods of learning, there are more options to each particular problem. Members of the department can begin learning skills that will assist the company&#8217;s growth, learn about new technologies that could reduce current costs, and learn new methods of execution with current toolsets, reducing implementation time and cost. Engaging the interests of the department members also serves to lengthen the amount of time they stay with the business, reducing the cost of finding and replacing people that have moved on. The department with an ongoing desire to learn and improve is a department with fewer people accomplishing more for less money. In most business it only takes one or two decisions to double your return from a single training course, whether that be selecting the right technology for a problem, not selecting the wrong one, creating more extensive backup routines, learning about a technology that shortens development time for every future project, or simply being able to better collaborate with other departments and customers.</p>
<h2>Improvement</h2>
<p>Improvement is a common theme in the manufacturing world and one that showed up in the previous &#8220;Learning&#8221; section. Improvement, or the drive to improve, is a crucial ingredient in an IT Department and business in general and is the arm arm of a triangle that, in my mind, leads to a world class IT group. Improvement goes beyond updating software and hardware or taking training classes. Improvement means facing our failures and learning from them, finding places where we are under performing and correcting root cause issues, or finding wastes in our department and altering our process to reduce them. Improvement is a cultural difference that often leads to enormous gains in productivity or cost reduction, as well as smoother processes and higher morale.</p>
<h3>Option: No Improvement</h3>
<p>Theer are many departments that have stagnated, that barely pursue the minimum of technical improvements to keep the lights on. They are change-averse, fearing any change as worse than where they currently stand. They likely have a strong core of people that have aged with the company and recall the trials it took to bring the company as far as it has come, but at some point their momentum was lost and they are coasting on that memory of achievement. The stagnation or lack of momentum eventually leads these groups backwards, slowly and in an uncontrolled fashion. Frequent unplanned overtime, increasing cost overruns, lack of a cohesive direction, lack of momentum, a steady reduction in quality, and ever more frequent insistence that all of this is normal are sign that a group is somewhere behind that curve. Climbing back out is an arduous process, but not attending to the issue is eventually an unsustainable decision.</p>
<h3>Option: Technology Improvement Only</h3>
<p>A group that only improves their technology is not in danger like the previous group, but they may be blind to answers that don&#8217;t require technology. Simple process changes will not occur as frequently as massive infrastructure projects, leading to increased cost and fewer potential options. A reliance on technology can also be reflected in common, recurring delays and outages, issues that the team believes can only be corrected by further technology investment. There may be some root cause analysis for common issues, but these are also relegated to a &#8220;need more technology&#8221; category or as un-fixable due to a legacy system that must be replaced. A side-effect of this method of handling issues is that there is a greater tendency to require users to use the systems correctly, rather than a focus on error-proofing the systems or improving usability.</p>
<h3>Option: Continuous Improvement Culture</h3>
<p>A group that accepts failures as learning experiences, constantly challenges itself to improve, and supports and grows their improvement efforts&#8230;this is a group that is considered &#8216;World Class&#8217; by their peers, regardless of the level of technology they are using. A system that is ailing and causing frequent business outages for a Technology-only group has shown improvements in the hands of a group seeking continuous improvement. Technology upgrades occur, but they occur not just to support the current state but also as a result of questioning that state, so that infrastructure morphs into more effective forms as the business grows, rather than simply being a continually upgraded version of what the company needed 10 years ago. Many technology costs and ongoing issues are limited or corrected by the group finding methods to improve their processes or systems without having to replace them. Missed timelines and cost overruns are dissected and their frequency is low and the causes understood and improved upon. Overtime is planned or occurs only in emergencies, never in a frequent, unplanned manner. Root cause results in technical as well as process suggestions, allowing more problems to be resolved earlier, freeing resources to work on more complex problems. Error proofing systems is adopted as more effective than building more user manuals, so error rate is reduced with lower ongoing cost to the business. Morale and respect in the group is higher because the culture supports everyone&#8217;s ideas as having merit and encourages members to bring new ideas or concepts to the team.<br />
Costs are lower, work is more effective, and goals are both more collaborative and more frequently achieved.</p>
<h2>Realistic?</h2>
<p>There are entire business management philosophies built around these concepts, as well as tools, workshops, training, and books. The contrast between a continuous improvement and stagnated environment can make the opposite almost unimaginable, but I can assure you have I experienced examples of every positive and negative in each of the examples above. </p>
<p>If an IT group is engaged with the business, serious about aligning themselves with the business goals, and actively seeking to improve themselves with those goals in mind, then I believe they have the foundation for everything they need. Learning will follow improvement, demanded by future business needs and improvement of existing systems and processes. And if the examples seem dream-like, then you should examine that feeling and decide what factors in your current environment makes those examples feel unreal. Then find 5 ways to improve those factors. Then challenge your coworkers to bring 5 more.</p>
