				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Chrome for over a year now and have been very happy with it. Yesterday version 5 was released, you can get it here: http://www.google.com/chrome</p>
<p>I decided to look at some stats for this site and compared April of this year to April of last year. The image below has this information.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//BrowserPercentage.PNG" alt="" title="" width="592" height="756" /></p>
<p>As you can see FireFox lost about 10% while Chrome gained 9% and Safari gained almost 1%. So what is going on, are the early adapters switching to Chrome from FireFox? Take a look at the <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1">NetMarket stats</a></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//stats.PNG" alt="" title="" width="750" height="242" /></p>
<p>FireFox had 24.72% of all bowser traffic in November, in April it had 24.59%, FireFox didn&#8217;t gain anything in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>So what is going on? When Internet Explorer 6 was the dominant browser it was very easy for FireFox to grab market share. Internet Explorer 6 was a mess, Internet Explorer 8 is better but still not as good as either FireFox or Chrome in my opinion.</p>
<p>So what will happen to FireFox will they ever pass 25% or is this a downward spiral and within a year Chrome will have that 25% and FireFox will be at 15% or so? With all the new stuff like the Google&#8217;s App Store that Google is adding to Chrome its usage will have to grow fast.</p>
<p>What browser do you use and did you try Chrome and if so did you like it?</p>
