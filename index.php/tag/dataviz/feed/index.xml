				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">I recently finished the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-You-See-Visualization-Quantitative/dp/0970601980/ref=la_B001H6IQ5M_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428393017&amp;sr=1-3">Now You See It: Simple Visualization Techniques for Quantitative Analysis</a> by Stephen Few of <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/">Perceptual Edge</a>. Stephen Few is a data visualization guru and his books about designed visualizations has changed my career in BI and how I develop reports and dashboards. Few currently has three books published (with <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1749">a fourth on its way</a>):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">I’m a huge fan of Few’s work and this blog post is meant as an introduction to his different titles, so people know what to expect when they read one of his books. I’ll review each of them in the order that I’ve read them (which actually has no specific meaning).</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify">Information Dashboard Design</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://amzn.to/1SnBSj9"><img class="alignnone" style="float: left;margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dashboard-150x150.jpg" alt="dashboard" width="150" height="150" /></a>This book really opened my eyes regarding data visualization best practices. I read the first edition, of which you can find my review <a href="/index.php/itprofessionals/book-review/data-visualization-book-review/">here</a>. I ordered the second edition the day it came out; the book is that good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As the title says, this book explains how to design dashboards efficiently. It introduces you to the principles of visual perception and how you can use those to make better dashboards. It also gives plenty examples of bad and good dashboard design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even though its focus is on dashboards, a lot of the design principles are true for regular reports and visualizations as well. I could apply them immediately at my job when creating SSRS reports.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify">Show me the Numbers</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://amzn.to/1Oejusx"><img class="alignnone" style="float: left;margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/showmethenumbers-150x150.jpg" alt="showmethenumbers" width="150" height="150" /></a>After reading <em>Information Dashboard Design</em>, I thought: “Great, now I know how to design dashboards and charts, but what about tables?” This book is the answer to that question. It gives a full overview on how to design data visualizations, be it tables or graphs. There are even some exercises in the book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This makes the book more complete than <em>Information Dashboard Design</em>. There is in fact quite some considerable overlap between the two books. If you want to buy only one book about data visualization, I recommend this one. If you are interested in dashboards only and how multiple graphs can interact on one page, then get the other book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are also some interesting appendices to this book, such as adjusting for inflation and how to create some chart types in Excel.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify">Now you see it</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://amzn.to/1OejBUY"><img class="alignnone" style="float: left;margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nowyouseeit-150x150.jpg" alt="nowyouseeit" width="150" height="150" /></a>The final book is a bit more different. While the other two books focus more on how to create data visualizations, this book goes into more detail on what you should do with those visualizations and why purpose they can serve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This book is meant for people using visualizations for analytic purposes. It describes what characteristics analysts should have, what kind of analytical interaction and navigation there is and how analytical software should support it. Very interesting to read, because even 6 years after this book has been published, not a single software product supports all of those features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It also describes analytical techniques such as using reference lines, reducing overplotting and using trellises. The book then talks about patterns and then details all the different types of relationships: time-series, ranking, deviation, distribution, correlation and multivariate analysis. Most of the time examples were made using Excel, Tableau or Spotfire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">All in all a very interesting book to read. I definitely recommend it for people who have to analyze data as part of their job.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">After my review of <a href="/index.php/webdev/business-intelligence/tableau-dashboard-cookbook-by-jen-stirrup/">Tableau Dashboard Cookbook</a>, I read another book about Tableau, namely <a href="http://amzn.to/1RzPjkU">Tableau Data Visualization Cookbook</a> by Ashutosh Nandeshwar. The book is published by Packt but I am relieved to say this time there were no significant editing issues. In fact it is quite well written and as far as I could tell there were no spelling mistakes or typos (yeah those things can really bug me out when reading a book).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The book promises “Over 70 recipes for creating visual stories with your data using Tableau”. That sounds like a lot and it is, because the book (the actual content, not counting preface, indexes …) is about 150 pages long. In other words, a little over 2 pages per recipe. In fact, I actually counted them (I have apparently nothing better to do). There are 74 recipes spread out over 147 pages, so 1.986 pages per recipe. Those are not long recipes. Some other numbers: the shortest recipe is 2 bullet points. It’s about adding a wildcard filter on a worksheet, but it actually builds upon a previous recipe, so it doesn’t count. The following scatter plot (created with Tableau of course) gives an overview of the various lengths of the recipes encountered in the book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scatterplot.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2898" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scatterplot.png" alt="scatterplot" width="500" height="598" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scatterplot.png 573w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scatterplot-250x300.png 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are quite a few very short recipes, which can easily be verified with a histogram:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/histogram.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2897" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/histogram.png" alt="histogram" width="500" height="521" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/histogram.png 725w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/histogram-288x300.png 288w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As you can notice, the distribution is a little bit skewed to the left (sorry for the sarcasm). Recipes with a length of 6 or shorter make up over 50% of the book. More statistics can be deduced from this box and whisker plot:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boxwhiskerplot.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2899" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boxwhiskerplot.png" alt="boxwhiskerplot" width="800" height="146" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boxwhiskerplot.png 973w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boxwhiskerplot-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What is my point in all this (aside from me giving the opportunity to myself to exercise creating some charts in Tableau)? The point is that this book is short and the recipes are too basic. 74 recipes in 150 pages, clearly the choice for quantity over quality has been made. It would have been much better if the bulk of those recipes were bundled into a few recipes who were longer but also more complex and challenging. Now most of the recipes just scratch the surface of a feature and never go into any depth. They are the equivalent of a recipe for boiling potatoes:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
<li>Peel potatoes.</li>
<li>Throw them in boiling water.</li>
<li>Wait for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on type of potatoes.</li>
<li>Bon appétit.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Maybe in another chapter you get a recipe for cooking vegetables and in another for grilling meat, but you don’t get instructions to cook a lovely meal with all of the ingredients (and now I’m hungry…). There are three chapter dealing with almost the same basic stuff: creating visualizations with one measure, creating visualizations with two measures and finally creating visualizations with multiple measures. Those should be combined in one single chapter with just a couple of interesting recipes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Another issue is that the author sometimes doesn’t bother to give more information on how the resulting visualization should be interpreted (from time to time the resulting visualization looks nice, but is rubbish from a business perspective becomes it doesn’t really give useful insights). Anyway, this is just a detail. The author does include a lot of links to reference material however, which is certainly a big plus. He also gives some good advice about the different types of charts, for example what the downsides are of pie charts and stacked area charts and how to avoid them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The book is way too basic and this because of the overly simplistic recipes. Get this book only if you are an absolute beginner in Tableau and have never read anything about this tool or if you are an absolute novice in data visualizations tools. In my opinion, the <a href="/index.php/webdev/business-intelligence/tableau-dashboard-cookbook-by-jen-stirrup/">Tableau Dashboard Cookbook</a> by Jen Stirrup offers considerable more depth (despite the editing issues) and you’ll learn more tricks than in this book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">DISCLAIMER</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I received this book through the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/reviews/">O’Reilly blogger review program</a>, which I already mentioned in the review of <a href="/index.php/datamgmt/thinking-with-data-by-max-shron/">Thinking With Data</a>. The actual publisher of the book is Packt Publishing, not O’Reilly itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">TABLEAU DASHBOARD COOKBOOK</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I guess most people who have been in contact with the SQL Server community have at least heard of Jen Stirrup (<a href="http://www.jenstirrup.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/jenstirrup">twitter</a>): she currently holds the PASS board seat for Europe, she has spoken at dozens of different events and has won the PASSion award in 2012. I have watched her speak at the SQL Server Days in Belgium a few times before and this year she will deliver <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/precon/#jen">a full precon about Power BI and R</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Let’s say I was a little bit excited when I heard she wrote<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781782177906.do"> a book about Tableau</a>. I had no experience whatsoever with Tableau, but I had seen some demos and visualizations so I was anxious to try out the product. I got myself the book and I downloaded the free trial of <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/desktop">Tableau Desktop 8.2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Note:</em> the trial is only 10 days, so if you want to finish the entire book in that time period, you better reserve some quality reading time for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tableau_dashboard_cookbook_cover.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2816" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tableau_dashboard_cookbook_cover.gif" alt="tableau_dashboard_cookbook_cover" width="180" height="222" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Let’s start with the good stuff. Personally I loved this book and the main reason is because it is very hands-on: there are a lot of examples (or recipes if you follow the cookbook doctrine) that guide you step-by-step through the features of Tableau. For readers inexperienced with Tableau – such as myself – this is a great way to discover the product without being overwhelmed by its many features. Each recipe starts with a short introduction – not too long so it doesn’t get tedious – and then dives directly into the action. At the end there is a small recap of what you just did and how it works and there are optionally some pointers to further references. The book is limited on theory but overloaded with practicalities, which was very appealing to me. I felt I learned a great deal about Tableau by reading this book, but I also realized I just learned the basic functionalities of the product. That’s why this book may not be suited for already advanced users of Tableau; they may not find a lot of new information in this book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A small disadvantage is that this book is (in theory) already outdated because it deals with Tableau 8.1, while the 8.2 version has just been released. However, I didn’t experience much difficulties over this. The only obvious difference is the import of multiple files, where there is now a much more graphical and easier to use interface to join tables together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Personally I found that this book is best read from front to back, as the recipes in a single chapter often depend on each other: you start with a blank worksheet and in each recipe you build on top of the other until you end with a working dashboard at the end of the chapter. Also, sometimes chapters depend on the finished dashboard of the previous chapter. This makes it a bit harder to just jump to a chapter in the book and do some recipes. Luckily you can download finished worksheets from the publishers’ website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What I found a little bit disappointing was the section in the final chapter about R, called <em>Wrapping up with R – dashboards as a tool</em>. I have been toying with the R language lately and I expected to see some cool stuff there. But there was only an introduction on how to install R with a package called Rserve and how to set-up a connection from within Tableau to Rserver. That’s it. No demonstration on how to actually use R with Tableau. I would have liked some more material over there, or maybe something in an addendum. An idea perhaps for a second edition? Anyway, this book is not about R but about Tableau <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now on to the bad stuff. Quite early on in the book – somewhere in chapter 2 – it became very clear that this book was badly edited. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes – not that I know of – but sometimes screenshots are switched or even wrong. One time a recipe – which is essentially a bulleted list of action points – jumped to the end while skipping a few steps. Sometimes when following the recipe step-by-step, you achieve a different result than what is displayed in a screenshot. Most of the time you can work around those issues by using your mind a bit and by comparing with (hopefully correct) screenshots. It can get annoying after a while, but it didn’t stop me from reading the book (unlike some delicate little flowers who wrote some reviews on Amazon) because there is still very great content inside it. But you would think that with 4 reviewers, 3 proofreaders and 10 (!) editors mistakes like these would have been avoided. I have contacted the author and she told me that the mistakes have been reported and should appear on the Errata page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">All in all, I recommend this book to people new to Tableau. They will definitely learn enough by this book to take their first steps with Tableau. A job well done by the author, but shame on you Packt Publishing for all those mistakes. Fire those editors please.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">UPDATE: the author (Jen Stirup) has placed <a href="http://www.jenstirrup.com/2014/07/packt-tableau-dashboard-cookbook-errata.html">errata about chapter 2 on her blog</a>.</p>

It has been a great gathering of the #sqlfamily, with superb sessions about Azure, restoring databases with PowerShell, Hekaton (yes yes In-Memory OLTP), Administration Intelligence (a new buzzword for marketing?), a glimpse into the new APS (Analytics Platform System, a blend of PDW and Hadoop that will knock your socks off) and of course my own session about data visualization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My session went pretty well: I had time left at the end and every demo went really OK (so sacrificing a virgin to the demo gods really does help, in case you are wondering). You can find the presentation at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KoenVerbeeck/get-more-out-of-your-data-visualizations">SlideShare</a> and you can download the demo code (SSRS report project and Excel worksheet) <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ITPROceed_DataViz_Demos.rar">here</a>.</p>
