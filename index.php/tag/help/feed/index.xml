				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is day twenty-four of the <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/sql-advent-2012-here-is">SQL Advent 2012 series</a> of blog posts. Today we are going to look at how to get help.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicky-/7089908693/" title="Help! by Vicky! &lt;3, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7068/7089908693_f5cb6d839a_m.jpg" width="240" height="125" alt="Help!" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" /></a>Imagine if you were stuck with some problem in 1995, you didn&#8217;t have that many choices, you could ask the resident <em>know it all</em> at your job, you could lookup stuff in a book or you could go on the newsgroups and try to get help that way. These days there are many more ways to get help. There are many more books than in 1995, there are also a lot more whitepapers available these days. Twitter is a great way to get help as well if you use a special hashtag. Attend one of the many <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/">SQL Saturday</a> events, there are always experts available who are willing to help you out with your problems. These events are held all over the world and there is a good chance one will be held near your town as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is day nine of the <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/sql-advent-2012-here-is">SQL Advent 2012 series</a> of blog posts. Today we are going to look at something called <em>reinventing the wheel</em>. Just in case your are not familiar with this metaphor or maybe you are not a native English speaker, I will use wikipedia&#8217;s description of what <em>reinventing the wheel</em> means.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciphershot/7139384947/" title="#124 Reinventing the Wheel by Ciphershot, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8166/7139384947_e4f67ac7ba_n.jpg" width="213" height="320" alt="#124 Reinventing the Wheel" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" /></a> From wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel</p>
<p><em>To <strong>reinvent the wheel</strong> is to duplicate a basic method that has already previously been created or optimized by others.<br />
The inspiration for this idiomatic metaphor lies in the fact that the wheel is the archetype of human ingenuity, both by virtue of the added power and flexibility it affords its users, and also in the ancient origins which allow it to underlie much, if not all, of modern technology. As it has already been invented, and is not considered to have any operational flaws, an attempt to reinvent it would be pointless and add no value to the object, and would be a waste of time, diverting the investigator&#8217;s resources from possibly more worthy goals which his or her skills could advance more substantially.</em></p>
<p>So now that you have read the paragraph above, how many times did you write some code only to find out that it already exists in the language as part of some library or function. How many times have you written code that you could have easily grabbed from GitHub, CodePlex and other repositories for your own use?</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Why write your own solution when you can use something that is robust and tested?</h2>
<p>Find out who the community leaders are for a particular skill set that you are interested in, start following these people, follow them on twitter, subscribe to their blogs and podcasts. Go to their presentations, talk to them, find out what they use, find out if they have made code available for the public to use. You will find out that a good percentage of these people have made available a whole bunch of libraries, stored procedures, functions, maintenance routines and much more for you to use and it is all free. <br />
Don&#8217;t be scared to ask for help on twitter, if you don&#8217;t know any of the SQL Server tweeple, use the #sqlhelp hash tag and ask for help, here is an example of what it looks like <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23sqlhelp&amp;src=typd">#sqlhelp</a></p>
<p>Here is an image of the replies on twitter after I asked a question with the #sqlhelp tag</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/ADvent/sqlhelp.PNG?mtime=1355070897"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/ADvent/sqlhelp.PNG?mtime=1355070897" width="516" height="438" /></a></div>
<p>Some commercial firms will also have community editions of code and tools for you to use. Take advantage of this, these are great, if you like the tools then maybe you will find a need for the pro editions, these have more bells and whistles and are not limited.</p>
<p>Some examples of available solutions.<br />
<strong>Index maintenance</strong><br />
Do you have scripts that do index maintenance, do you have to modify these scripts often because of bugs or changing requirements? Take a look at <a href="http://ola.hallengren.com/sql-server-index-and-statistics-maintenance.html">SQL Server Index and Statistics Maintenance</a> by <a href="http://ola.hallengren.com/">Ola Hallengren</a></p>
<p>Also check out this index defrag script by <a href="http://sqlfool.com/">Michelle Ufford</a> <a href="http://sqlfool.com/2011/06/index-defrag-script-v4-1/">Index Defrag Script, v4.1</a></p>
<p><strong>SQL Server activity</strong><br />
Want to know what is going on right now? Try <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/default.aspx">Adam Machanic&#8217;s</a> procedure <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/archive/2012/03/22/released-who-is-active-v11-11.aspx">Who Is Active</a></p>
<p><strong>The state of your SQL Server</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar Unlimited</a> has a neat proc you can run which will give you a fast health check, get it here: <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/blitz/">sp_Blitz</a>. There is also a video showing how to use this proc</p>
<p><strong>Potential problems in your SQL Server database</strong><br />
Try our own <a href="http://sqlcop.lessthandot.com/">SQLCop</a> tool, this tool was written by <a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;author=10">George Mastros</a> and will highlight potential problems</p>
<p><strong>Execution Plans</strong><br />
SQL Sentry has a free version of <a href="http://www.sqlsentry.net/plan-explorer/sql-server-query-view.asp">SQL Sentry Plan Explorer</a>. This plan explorer does much more than the one that comes with SQL Server Management Studio</p>
<h2>Get involved</h2>
<p>If you have created some cool code and you know there is nothing similar, why now give back to the community? Put it out there, solicit feedback and in the end the code will be better because more eyes will have looked at it. Accept contributions as well. All of these things will make the community as a whole grow, if the community grows then the platform will grow as well. When the platform grows, this means there will be more demand for someone with your skill set. You are responsible that your community doesn&#8217;t turn into a ghost town.</p>
<h2>Do you know of great SQL Server tools/scripts/procs</h2>
<p>If you feel that there is great code/tools out there for SQL Server that I did not mention, leave me a comment and I will check it out and add it to this post</p>
<p>That is all for day nine of the <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/sql-advent-2012-here-is">SQL Advent 2012 series</a>, come back tomorrow for the next one, you can also check out all the posts from last year here: <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/sql-advent-2011-recap">SQL Advent 2011 Recap</a></p>

<p>This week brought one of the highest achievements in my career and community work.  On June 23rd it was announced by Red Gate and SQL Server Central that I had made it into the finalists for the Exceptional DBA of the Year award.  WOW!  Every time I say it, I still get that feeling in my gut only certain things that you are truly emotional about can bring.  </p>
<p><strong>June 23rd, 2010</strong></p>
<p>The morning that the announcement went out I was completely blown away, not only by the nomination, but by the reactions and support from the SQL Community.  Twitter, personal email, IM, Facebook, Linkedin and every other online communication method had messages congratulating me on this remarkable accomplishment and wishes for luck on winning. </p>
<p>This was also the day I was able to see who the other finalists were.  I was more than pleased to see Jorge Segarra (<a href="http://sqlchicken.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlchicken">Twitter</a>) and Jonathan Kehayias (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jonathan_kehayias/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlsarg">Twitter</a>) in the final six.  Jorge is a leader in the SQL Community.  I could easily see that from the creation of SQL University and when I was lucky enough to have him come speak at SQL Saturday in Chicago.  Jonathan is another person that the word exceptional fits with without a doubt.  I’ve been very fortunate over the last few months to get to know him better and, for my part, call him a friend.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still reading about Kevan Riley, John Burnette and Tracy Hamlin.  I can guarantee that these other three finalists are nothing short of exceptional simply by making it to this accomplishment as well.  I hope to meet all of them at PASS or in their local areas during SQL Saturday’s or SSUG’s. </p>
<p><strong>How did I get here?</strong></p>
<p>I have to thank Rose Waters (<a href="http://twitter.com/sqlrose">Twitter</a>) dearly.  Rose works on my team as a SQL Developer, and she is a great one at that.  She nominated me for this award which means more to me than I can express in a blog.  The one thing I strive for is to help the people around me, and try to create an atmosphere that we all want to come into daily.  The fact that Rose did this for me means I’m doing a good job at that goal.  Every time I hear Rose is attending User Groups meetings, posting on <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23sqlhelp">#SQLHELP</a> and interacting with the community I get a huge smile.  To help Rose and others get involved in this awesome community is the most important goal I have and can accomplish for myself. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Thanks Rose!!!!</strong></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/thanks.gif" alt="" title="" width="200" height="133" /></div>
</p>
<p><strong>The week in play</strong></p>
<p>The week following the announcement has been nonstop jaw dropping events.  The next day, my Google alerts had blown up on me and I was off looking at how big this nomination was.  Several news sites had announced the start of the community voting process, and many of the people I look up to and have a very high level of respect for had blogged on the announcement.  I found that even CNBC had the announcement the next day.  Each day brought another jaw dropping moment.  Thursday, I received a call from my local news paper.  The reporter had found out about the award and nomination, and wanted to report on the news in the weekends publications.  At this point I’m still just amazed at this entire nomination. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/">SQL Server Central</a></strong></p>
<p>I feel the Exceptional DBA of the Year award that Red Gate and SQL Server Central have created is the utmost prestigious award in the SQL Server field.  To be a finalist is an honor and accomplishment.  The part of this nomination that is most special to me is that my peers are doing the nominating and voting.  There is no more gratifying feeling and reward than knowing your hard work is respected by so many others and you have helped them with their own growth in the community and personal careers.    That is, without a doubt in my mind, the power of the SQL Community.  We stand together and support each other no matter who the other person is.  In my mind, we are all exceptional in that way. </p>
<p><strong>Cast Your Vote!</strong></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/vote.gif" alt="" title="" width="200" height="168" align="left" /></div>
<p></p>
<p>Winning this award would be one of the highest accomplishments possible in my career. I’d love to say, “Vote for me!” But, what I sincerely would like everyone to do is take a few minutes and read about all of the finalists. If you don’t know one of them from the community or personally, take a few minutes to research and find out what they have accomplished in their career. They have made it this far, and deserve the attention and recognition. Each of these DBAs is exceptional. It’s a hard decision, but do your best to vote for the person you truly feel is the most exceptional.</p>

Before we get started, I’d like to say it has been nothing short of a pleasure writing the last two weeks for SQL University.  All of the discussions and topics we a lot of fun to go over and I’m looking forward to hearing from everyone how they were able to use them.  Don’t forget to pass SQL University and the community itself on to the person to your side that may not be aware of them.  Let’s keep building this community together!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the last day of Community Service week for <a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university">SQL University</a>.  Before we get started, I’d like to say it has been nothing short of a pleasure writing the last two weeks for SQL University.  All of the discussions and topics were a lot of fun to go over and I’m looking forward to hearing from everyone how they were able to use them.  Don’t forget to pass SQL University and the community itself on to the person to your side that may not be aware of them.  Let’s keep building this community together!</p>
<p><strong>The last one means, TEST!</strong></p>
<p>Today being our last day of community service week, we’re going to take a quiz.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/quiz.gif" alt="" title="" width="160" height="201" /></div>
<p>Kidding!!!  (I think an apple just whizzed by my head)</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> are up to bat and we have a plethora of them available to us in the community.   Between Jes, Coach LaRock and I authoring community service week, we have covered a ton of community information.  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/meet-the-sql-server-community/">Meet the SQL Server Community! </a>– (6/14) by Jes Borland</li>
<li><a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/sql-community-tech-forums">SQL Server Forums-Helping to Build a Knowledge Base </a>(6/15) by Ted Krueger </li>
<li><a href="http://thomaslarock.com/2010/06/sql-university-community-service-week/">DBA Coach LaRock: Community Service Week </a>(6/16)</li>
<li><a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/sql-community-professional-association-of-sql-server/">SQL Community: Professional Association of SQL Server</a> – (6/17) by Jes Borland</li>
<li><a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/sql-community-blogging">Let’s Blog!</a> &#8211; (6/17) by Ted Krueger</li>
</ul>
<p>You could almost take what we’ve gone over and spend the next 2 years diving into just those topics.  There is one other corner of the community that I find to be exceptional that cannot go without discussion.  That is, the companies that stand behind us. </p>
<p>If you are reading this and have been part of a SQL Saturday, SQL Server User Group, Pod cast or any type of resource that requires funds, you already know exactly how devoted SQL related companies are to supporting the SQL Community.  Quest, Red-Gate, Pragmatic Works, Confio, Idera…the list goes on and on.  These companies all sell products that help us make life easier for a DBA or DB Developer.   As many say, they help us be lazy database administrators.</p>
<p>These companies take the vast amount of resources and pour them into building the community.  </p>
<p>Quest Software is a great example.  Quest has not only been a major sponsor for dozens of SQL events but also spends a great deal of resources on providing things like, &#8220;<a href="http://sqlserver.quest.com/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=291">The pain of the week</a>&#8221; to the community.   <a href="http://sqlserverpedia.com/">SQLServerPedia</a> is a huge resource powered by Quest with Mr. Ozar leading the way.  You could without a doubt spend a month reading, watching and learning from <a href="http://sqlserverpedia.com/">SQLServerPedia</a>. </p>
<p>Red-Gate is another great company supporting the community in a number of ways,  from the <a href="http://www.exceptionaldba.com/">Exceptional DBA of the Year</a> recognition that is going on right now, to the work that Steve Jones (<a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/steve_jones/default.aspx">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/way0utwest">Twitter</a>)and Brad McGehee (<a href="http://www.bradmcgehee.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/bradmcgehee">Twitter</a>) do for the community backed by Red-Gate.  Red-Gate stands behind the community and does a great deal for us all.  And did I mention the SQL Tools rock?</p>
<p>Pragmatic Works is one of my favorite online free resources in the community.  There are so many <a href="http://www.pragmaticworks.com/Resources/webinars/Default.aspx">webinars</a> provided to the community to build on, you could spend another month just watching them to catch up.  Pragmatic Works has an entire <a href="http://www.pragmaticworks.com/Resources/Default.aspx">resource page</a> devoted to the webinars, whitepapers, articles and my personal favorite, the SSIS Cheat Sheet.  Pragmatic Works is a resource that is valued and highly recommended to everyone that touches anything SQL Server related.</p>
<p>I hardly even scratched the surface of these companies&#8217; devotion and support of the SQL Community.   There are dozens of others that I could sit down and praise for everything they do daily.  I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have worked with some of them during SQL Saturdays and User Groups and sat down to talk with them.  If you have a chance to find them at one of these events or meetings, stop by and get to know them.  You will be amazed at just how much they are involved in the community and the passion that comes out for it.  </p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget these resources</strong></p>
<p>Having lunch at your desk today while we talk about all these cool resources we have?  Good!  We can talk about <a href="http://www.sqllunch.com/">SQL Lunch</a>.  SQL Lunch is another resource that is absolutely free and invaluable.   SQL Lunch is composed of the entire world as a location.  There are speakers from all over that take their time out to hold sessions during the lunch hour (in some time zones).  I know I can’t think of a better way to spend my lunch.  And I know if you are a DBA or DB Developer, you are eating at your desk just as often as I do.</p>
<p>SQL Share is another virtual training resource.  SQL Community leaders such as <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/13986/JessicaMoss.aspx">Jessica Moss</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/1379/Jonathan-Kehayias.aspx">Jonathan Kehayias</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/7/Brian-Knight.aspx">Brian Knight</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/18/Andy-Warren.aspx">Andy Warren</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/2626/Grant-Fritchey.aspx">Grant Fritchey</a> and many more are all part of providing this free resource.  These are web casts that focus on SQL Server topics and get right down to it.  They have an amazing talent for making the difficult topics very easy so you pick them up fast and do them the right way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/">Simple-Talk</a>: Do I need to say more?  I spend a lot of time on Simple-Talk.  The amount of knowledge that is held in this resource is almost frightening.  If you sat back and thought of trying to build a knowledge base and author listing like the one on this site, you would think it is impossible.  But it is there and if you don’t use it, you need to start.</p>
<p><strong>Scratched it</strong></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/scratch.gif" alt="" title="" width="250" height="245" align="left" /></div>
<p>Yes, I scratched again.  I’ve only named a handful of places you can find resources to build your knowledge and networking in the SQL Community.  <strong>There is an enormous amount the SQL Community has to offer</strong>.  The homework for everyone is to go out and find people that do not know about the SQL Community and make them aware.  Nothing is ever perfect and everything can build higher and out farther.  The SQL Community has a lot of space to grow and growing with it is the reward we all shall share.</p>
<p>I’ve had a great time doing SQL University the last two weeks.  I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I have.  As with all of the sessions, I welcome your suggestions on making things better for all of us.  If you would, please take the time to fill out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university/">SQL University</a> is one of the greatest concepts I&#8217;ve seen in the SQL Community.  Thanks to Jorge Segarra (<a href="http://sqlchicken.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/SQLChicken">Twitter</a>)for coming up with it and organizing it.  Today we are going to talk about something dear and close to the concept of SQL University.  Blogging!  Blogs are an important part of the concept of SQL University.  With them we can easily bring this wealth of knowledge in the course syllabus format with writers from the SQL Community in a vast geographical range and range of expertise.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/blog.gif" alt="" title="" width="296" height="280" /></div>
<p>Getting your day-to-day experiences and knowledge out to the community can be tough sometimes.  We can share what we know and what we learn with the teams we work in, but the walls of our building keep that from going far.  Blogging removes the wall and much does much more for our personal growth.  </p>
<p>Promoting and sharing blogs doesn’t only bring with it satisfaction of sharing what you’ve learned but also allows you to help everyone in the community so we can all build our knowledge base.</p>
<p><strong>My own personal story of blogging</strong></p>
<p>
I wrote my first blog in November of 2008.  The title was, &#8220;<a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBAdmin/MSSQLServerAdmin/user-to-schema-to-roles-for-controlling-">User to Schema to Roles for controlling security</a>&#8220;.  I won’t lie; I have learned an enormous amount about how to blog since then.  I’ve learned more about writing period!  Writing is an art form and catching the audience’s attention is important when you write your blogs.  The best part of blogging and writing in general is that everyone has their own way of getting the audience’s attention with humor, technical skills and just downright talent.  You hold that talent inside you, but you need to try it to find it and build on it. </p>
<p>In the SQL Community, we have hundreds (if not thousands) of bloggers out there writing daily and providing step-by-step articles that help us learn new things, fix old things and become better DBA’s all around.   So why write your own if the wealth of knowledge exists and is still pouring out of all of these SQL Community members?</p>
<p><i>If it is written already, I don’t need to write it.</i>  <-- Horrible statement! 


<p>The one reason I can give you to not hold back on starting up your own blog and sharing your SQL Server trials is: everyone sees a situation differently and replays that situation to an audience in many different ways.  Your way (yes, yours) can be the way that a hundred people grasp while other perspectives leave them with questions.  That reason alone takes, &#8220;it&#8217;s already done&#8221; and throws it down the truncate statement.  (Haha! SQL nerd humor is awesome!)  </p>
<p><strong>Let people review them</strong></p>
<p>Letting your guard down and sending your drafted blogs to friends and peers in the SQL Community can be hard.  No one likes to be marked by a red pen or be told that the entire blog may need a new direction.  In some cases, technical reviews find errors and mistakes all over the entire process and even directions describing why what you are telling everyone might not be the best way to do it.</p>
<p>A perfect example is a blog on using TRUNCATE_ONLY.   SHRINK and TRUNCATE_ONLY are just bad.  (Paul Randal (<a href="http://sqlskills.com/blogs/paul">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/paulrandal">Twitter</a>) <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/post/backup-log-with-no_log-use-abuse-and-undocumented-trace-flags-to-stop-it.aspx">says so</a>.) Very bad!  Google TRUNCATE_ONLY log and you will find plenty of bad advice, unfortunately.  The use of this option and action is really not a good thing to do on your SQL Servers.  We do see a lot of blogs going out on the topic though, and complete step-by-step instructions on how to do it.  If these blogs were placed under a technical review, the author may have gotten this reply:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Ted, I hate to say it but the blogs needs a lot of help in the technical realm.   Your steps are perfect and solid for anyone to take and get a shrinkfile working.  No doubt about that!  The problem is, you don’t say anything about why shrinkfile is not good and when to use it.  Just says: do it!  I could see how that might lead to a DBA putting a shrinkfile (or database) into a job and running it endlessly.  I would definitely add a description of the action and emergencies where it really is only called on.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I can also honestly say that most of the SQL Community and bloggers we have would be polite and respectful in while doing a review like this.  </p>
<p>While on this topic; thanks to Jes Borland (<a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/grrl_geek">Twitter</a>) for reviewing this blog and adding to it.  </p>
<p><strong>Practice if you are unsure</strong></p>
<p>Are you still unsure about blogging?  Practice a few blogs.  Write them and save them in a lost sea of folders in your Documents.  When you do that, keep your eyes and ears open in the community.  I can pretty much guarantee you that at some point, someone is going to mention the situation you wrote about either happened to them or they need help on it.  Then scramble to get your blog up and give it to them! </p>
<p><strong>Which blogs should I read?</strong></p>
<p>There are leaders in the SQL Community and those leaders all actively blog (and blog a lot).   The list could go on forever if we put them into this lesson, but luckily enough we have PASS to the rescue as always.  PASS collected a list of community bloggers and <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/Community/BlogDirectory.aspx">posted it</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Still not convinced?</strong></p>
<p>Mike Walsh contributes a lot to the SQL Community.  A little while ago Mike spent the time writing a series on blogging.  The blog series starts with a <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2009/12/interview-with-mike-walsh-about-blogging/">video chat session with Brent Ozar</a> on experiences with blogging.  Then the series goes into, &#8220;<a href="http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2009/12/why-should-i-blog/">Why I should blog</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2009/12/how-should-i-blog/">How should I blog</a>&#8221; and the second part of the <a href="http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2009/12/blogging-tips-brent-ozar-mike-walsh-interview/">interview with Brent</a>.  The series is excellent and answers a lot of questions and pumps you up to get into blogging SQL Server and about the community.  If I haven’t convinced you how blogging can be extremely gratifying, Mike will.  </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to attend another SQL University course! Please take the time to fill out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a>.</p>

<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/sqlu_tiny.gif" alt="" title="" width="54" height="60" align="left" /></div>
<p>Welcome to another day of the Community Service week for <a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university">SQL University</a>.  Jes Borland (<a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/grrl_geek">Twitter</a>) wrote an <a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/meet-the-sql-server-community/">excellent class</a> yesterday on the SQL Community and areas that help connect us all.  Today we&#8217;re going to move on into the service parts of the SQL community and show how we can keep building the community.  I’d like to thank Jes again for helping author todays topic on technical forums.  </p>
<p>As with all SQL University weeks, please take a moment to rate us by filling out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a>.  We greatly appreciate your feedback so we can all become better.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re devoting an entire class to technical forums this week.  Forums have been around as long as most of the online community services have been.  They offer (mostly) unsolicited help at (mostly) no charge to the person requesting the help.  The word mostly worked its way into that last statement quite a bit.  There are resources out there that will allow the solicitation of the members and will charge for help.  This class is not going to discuss any of those services.  Why?  Because we are discussing the SQL community and this community truly puts itself out in front of everyone in need without asking for much of anything in return.  The community devotes countless hours to supporting the strong foundation that it has constructed over the years.  Rarely will you find a part of it in which a request for money, goods or payback will be requested or expected.  In most cases, the gratitude of the solution being worked out amongst ourselves is the reward and payback.   The community takes that to heart and it is why you may not find another group like the SQL community.</p>
<p><strong>All bases covered</strong></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/big _circle.gif" alt="" title="" width="645" height="504" /></div>
<p>SQL Server has grown to cover a wide flavor of specialized fields over the last decade.  Business Intelligence, CLR specialists, Tuning Experts, Mud Wrestling administrators, SAN Experts, Broker Experts, Full Text Search Experts, T-SQL Experts…the list goes on and on.  A lot of these experts fit into groups such as the BI group, the SQL Programming group and the DBA group.  In each of these groups you will find leaders that jump at the opportunity to throw what they know out into the public to help with any problems, new development or implementations.  These members of the community often are referred to as answerers.  And even the answerers turn to the others for help in the time of need, so we all become answerers in the community. </p>
<p><strong>The list</strong></p>
<p>How do you find these leaders and others that devote even minutes of their day to helping?</p>
<p>Below is a list of some sites that I, and other authors this semester, visit daily or hourly,  or sometimes lurk at with their finger on the refresh button:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/category/sqlserver/">MSDN SQL Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://serverfault.com/">Serverfault</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/">SQLServerCentral Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlteam.com/forums/">SQL Team Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewforum.php?f=14&amp;sid=95273364bfa1d4cbee1b6a2bf998431b">LessThanDot.com SQL Forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These forums are available for free and are a resource that should not be set to the side lightly.  The members of these forums all have a great deal of unique, real-life experiences to share, and will help in building your own knowledge.   If everyone in the community helps build the forums, the knowledge base that can be composed is truly infinite in nature. </p>
<p><strong>Reward yourself by giving back</strong></p>
<p>When asking questions in forums around the SQL community, there is one way that you will find even more value in the resource.  Start answering the questions and helping others!  No one knows the answer to everything!  What will often happen is that you can assist in searching other resources, testing on your resources that may not be available to the other people asking for help or simply work through the problem and troubleshoot in your unique way.  This builds both sides in learning more about SQL Server and everyone benefits. </p>
<p>Never feel uncomfortable helping others.  Helping is one of the foundations of increasing your knowledge of SQL Server.  Everyone won’t run into the same problem in our careers working on SQL Server, so we may never be exposed to specific situations.  By giving back on these forums and working through issues that you may not have come across, you benefit by learning the situation, path to recovery and complete solution.  Imagine the power behind that knowledge if the same problem comes up in your own environment someday!  So when you ask a question on one of these SQL Server forum resources, think about looking around to see if you might be able to help out and give a little back.  You may just become addicted like many of us have over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Obligation</strong></p>
<p>It is absolutely critical to understand that the members in these forums do not have a binding agreement to help nor are they obligated in any way to stick through it.  Usually, the members helping will go to great lengths to solve the problems.  If a person does not stick through it though, becoming frustrated with them is usually not the best reaction.  The member helping may have had a problem of their own come up, or had to leave their computer for a time.  Every reply is given for free and as-is.  Reacting negatively when a member that is helping you leaves abruptly may cause repercussions in the future, when you have another question. </p>
<p>When every resource fails you: Books Online, real books, your secret cube buddy that knows how to write SELECT *, the help desk solution of reboot doesn’t work &#8211; give the technical forums a try.  When you get an answer and are sitting back relaxing, push the chair back to the keyboard and see if you can return the favor by helping on the next thread under yours.</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/crazy_hair_puller.gif" alt="" title="" width="101" height="160" align="left" /></div>
<p>There is no need to pull your hair out at the roots; no need to call the CTO and tell them you quit before they fire you for not being able to fix it; no need to literally break down.  Give it a try and post your situation on a SQL Server forum.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised at the results you receive.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
Tuesday marked the day that I presented on SSIS basics.  The night went really good and the group and I had a great time during the discussion.  Kim Young (needs to be on twitter) started us off with stored procedures and error handling and moved into Wendy (<a href="http://wendyverse.blogspot.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/wendy_dance">Twitter</a>) plugging PASS and the community.
</p>
<p>
The group I presented to was about the best group you could get in front of you.  Several questions were asked along the way and several attendees jumped in with their own real-life experiences and tips to SSIS trials and successes.  SSIS basics itself is a difficult session to fit in one night.  From the feedback I received after the session, I was glad to hear that several were going to do just that and jump right in.  A few attendees stayed after asking many questions about SQL Server internals and some other things they had in their own installations.  If you are attending one of these sessions, don’t hesitate to do the same.  I know I truly enjoy helping in any way and getting the one on one discussions going is great for all of us to gain more knowledge.
</p>
<p>
The slides that were used for the session can be downloaded below.  I’ve also included the SSIS package and test import file that the group and I went through while learning some things about SSIS.  If you download the package, all you need to do to get it to work with your own test lab and instance is fill in the variables, sqlconn and dbname respectfully.   Then place the import.txt on your C drive and away you go!

<p>
If you have any problems or questions, feel free to jump into the LessThanDot forums and ask away.  The site is all yours and we’re sitting here waiting to throw a helping hand all the time.<br />
<br />
I can’t wait to have the opportunity to jump back in with this group and present again!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d also liked to thank &#8220;Everyone&#8221; that pitched in and gave Wendy, Aaron and I the gift for putting on SQL Saturday in Chicago.  That was way over the top thoughtful!  Thank you!!!</p>

<p>
SQL Saturday in Chicago is only days away now and the excitement is building.  I feel an explanation is in order for my lack of contributions to the SQL community the last few weeks.  SQL Saturday has taken a lot time to work on coupled with the normal daily work schedule.  Last minute preparations are going well and I think all of the attendees, speakers and sponsors will be very happy with how the event will come together.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/sqlsatpost.gif" alt="" title="" width="367" height="262" align="center" /></div>
</p>
<h2>LessThanDot the sponsor!</h2>
<p>
Over the last year I started seeing many other communities mention the LTD community as a well respected site for information and assistance.  LTD has become a site that prides itself on the blogs published and the help we all strive to provide between the Wiki and forum communities.  Denis Gobo has truly formed the SQL Wiki sections into a vast index of real-life experiences in the form of scripts and catches in the SQL Server programming and administrative tasks.  I find myself relying on the Wiki during my daily tasks myself.  I’ve shared my own common scripts and experiences over the years and will be pushing myself to do more in the month to come. </p>
<p><div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/sqlcop.gif" alt="" title="" width="396" height="89" align="left" /></div>
<p>George created a new project that he shared with the LTD named, SQLCop.   I am excited about this project and can’t wait to jump in when the upcoming events free some time to devote to the group working on SQLCop.  The tool will analyze SQL Server instances for best practices.  I hope to add all of my knowledge in the administrative side of SQL Server to SQLCop.  I will leave most of the details out on the project while it is in development but highly recommend checking back for the release to the community. </p>
<p>With all of the other contributors devoting their time to LTD, the site and community has become a great foundation to the developer and database communities.  When Wendy and Aaron presented me with the opportunity to help work on organizing SQL Saturday in Chicago, I thought this was a good way for LTD to make the next step in the community by requesting to be a sponsor of the event.  This has given me the chance to let more people in the SQL community know about the resources on LTD.  </p>
<p>
LTD has also contributed to the raffle prizes that attendees will win in the closing hours of SQL Saturday.  The prizes include a copy of SQL Server Deep Dives and 2 30GB SSD drives. </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/ssd_sqlsat.gif" alt="" title="" width="500" height="270" align="center" /></div>
<p>I have to admit that when the SSD drives arrived I was tempted to order another one for myself.  One of my goals in the early part of this year is to play with SSD drive technology and SQL Server performance.  I have set that for late June lab testing.  Let’s hope the funds for the drives exist then to keep that goal alive.  Most of my direction on IO in general always comes from Kendal Van Dyke.  If you are a SQL Server DBA that wants to know more on IO, Kendal is the person I always recommend following.  I’ve also read SQL Server Deep Dives and have been pushing this recommendation ever since.  The MVPs truly did a remarkable job on this book and should be in any database professionals’ library.
</p>
<p>
Eli (Tarwn) of LTD is also flying out to promote the site and also volunteer his time to helping during the event.  It’s always a great time when friends can visit.  I can’t wait to tell him he’s been nominated to babysit the kids while my beautiful wife Michelle and I go have some time alone.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<p>
To everyone traveling to SQL Saturday in Chicago, I wish a safe trip.  Don’t forget to stop by and introduce yourself and learn more about LTD and where it will be going in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Will you be my friend?</h2>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/friends.gif" alt="" title="" width="134" height="149" align="left" /></div>
<p>When it comes to database performance issues, finding the cause and the resolution is usually half the battle, if not most of it. But when the database involved is vendor-provided, getting the resolution implemented can actually be another (long) story. Not only does the vendor have to be involved, they also have to somewhat agree to the resolution and participate actively in implementing it. This is the reason it is so important to build a good relationship with your vendor—and to do so <strong><i>before</i></strong> it’s actually needed.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Make a professional relationship</h2>
<p>
How do you do this? The answer to the question is simple and can be done with a few emails or calls over time. This relationship should start as early as the review process before choosing to purchase the software for you business requirements.  Interact with the vendors in the demo process to build respect between each other.  Even when problems are not present, it can be an asset to keep in touch with key individuals that are handling or working directly on the database structure.  You will be able to react more quickly and successfully to performance issues in vendor-provided databases if you already have a good, working relationship with the vendor.  This doesn’t necessarily mean calling them up daily and talking to them about your NCAA picks (in fact that may not be a good idea at all).  You want to build a technical relationship on a professional level but at the same time build trust and respect for each other. Portray your abilities, concerns, thoughts and understanding of the database the vendor has taken great time in creating.   </p>
<p><div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/fishmarket.gif" alt="" title="" width="600" height="450" /></div>
<p>Think of it as a fish market shopping experience. If you have a good rapport with the fish vendor, you will most likely get the big tuna behind the counter and not the Chinese carp that they are trying to pawn off as a walleye displayed on the shelf. </p>
<h2>Don’t break the relationship</h2>
<p>
When the problem does occur, don’t’ be rude. Don’t flame their design. You don’t want to be sent back to the first-level support process. Once you’ve broken the relationship, rebuilding can be in some cases, impossible.<br />
<br />
Here’s a good example. A few weeks ago, a database behind a warehouse management system started to show progressive performance problems. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that forwarded records on HEAP tables were the root cause of the performance problems.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Finding forwarded records can be done with the following query written by Jonathan Kehayias (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jonathan_kehayias/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlsarg">Twitter</a>)</p>

<p>To learn more about forwarded records and HEAP issues, check Sankar Reddy’s (<a href="http://sankarreddy.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/SankarReddy13">Twitter</a>) blog, &#8220;<a href="http://sankarreddy.com/2010/03/how-can-i-tell-if-a-sql-server-system-is-affected-by-forwarded-records/">How can I tell if a SQL Server system is affected by Forwarded records?&#8221;</a> and also a very good <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/sqldatabaseengine/thread/972f68d2-bbc2-4f89-8757-fe1bc7295a3a">reply</a> from Jonathan Kehayias (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jonathan_kehayias/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlsarg">Twitter</a>) in the msdn forums <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/sqldatabaseengine/thread/972f68d2-bbc2-4f89-8757-fe1bc7295a3a">here</a>.<br />
Once the problem was identified as forwarded records on a HEAP table, it was found that the table had a unique non-clustered index.  This left the opportunity to resolve the forwarded records issue by converting the unique non-clustered index into a clustered index and would resolve the problems.<br />
<br />
Even knowing the problem and solution to this problem was quickly identified, the database is still a vendor database so altering the structure surly void all support agreements. However, given the rapport with the vendor that was already established, a well composed email explaining the problem in great detail was all that was needed.<br />
<br />
The email (has been altered to keep to a NDA):</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Good morning everyone,</p>
<p>I have identified a forwarded records issue with the {name removed} database that is causing some performance problems.  I’ve narrowed the problem to two HEAP tables listed below<br />
Table1<br />
Table2<br />
Both tables do not have a clustered index but have unique non-clustered indexes. Is there specific reason behind the unique non-clustered index over a clustered? I was thinking it may benefit the performance to replace the non-clustered index with a clustered index. This will remove the HEAP and then possibly fix the performance bottleneck of the forwarded records?</p>
<p>The forwarded records count is very high on both tables so I would like to see if the index change can be performed without affecting the structure and functionality of the entire process these tables support. Please let me know your thoughts.  If you want to jump on a conference call and or WebEx to go over this in detail, I’d more than happy to. Our sessions always turn out with great results and look forward to them.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
The DBA<br />
</i></p></blockquote>
<p>
The reply from the vendor was good. The relationship that was already created made this major alteration to the tables quick and painless. The vendor immediately discussed the situation with the database architects in their team and came to the conclusion the change was a sound and stable improvement. The change was also added to updates that would be going out so the database changes would be reflected to all of the customers. Because a good relationship already existed between us, the major alteration to the tables was quick and painless. </p>
<p>Without the effort put forth to create the good relationship with the vendor, this task could have been a long and drawn out process. Worse, the performance problem could have remained on the database and any workaround fix (from us) would have been at best, temporary. </p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<p>Call your vendor and begin to create a professional relationship with them. Introduce yourself. Send them an email.</p>

<h2>Why don&#8217;t you know this?</h2>
<p>
This is an extension of &#8220;<a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/help-around-the-corner-for-sql">Finding SQL Server Support – Become an expert yourself</a>&#8221; much more personal discussion than other topics that I typically write about. In my efforts to be useful to the SQL Community, I have often met SQL DBAs and Developers who are just hanging around the sidelines, completely unaware of <strong>how much</strong> SQL Server help and support are out there. Surprisingly, although they sort of know that they can find answers online, they really don’t know the lengths to which respected people in the SQL community will go to help them.
</p>
<p>
Some have not even heard of community and support tools like LessThanDot.com, the MSDN forums, or even the SQL community on Twitter. Those who do know about them are hesitant to actively engage the community or the community’s leaders. Reasons include shyness, fear, a bad experience with someone egotistical dude in a forum, or simply a reluctance to waste someone else’s time. Guess what though, simply put, there’s really nothing to fear.
</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/community.jpg" alt="" title="" width="534" height="368" /></div>
<h2>Get over the fear</h2>
<p>
Approaching people can be daunting. Engagaging experts can be downright intimidating. It takes some courage to take that first step, to join a community where everyone seems to know more than you do, or to directly ask someone, whose name you saw in the front cover of a SQL Server book, a question.<br />
<br />
Before, I was in the same boat.  I thought brilliant minds like Brent Ozar (<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/brento">Twitter</a>), Buck Woody (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckwoody/default.aspx">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/buckwoody">Twitter</a>), Paul Randal (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/paulrandal">Twitter</a>), Jonathon Kehayias (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jonathan_kehayias/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlsarg">Twitter</a>) or Denis Gobo (<a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;author=4">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/denisgobo">Twitter</a>) would laugh me out of my cube if I asked them a SQL Server question. <i>Are you kidding me?</i> Do I dare ask about a simple issue and risk them thinking that I’m not smart enough to figure it out? I realized a few things when I got over the fear and took the first step. First, there’s no such thing as a simple problem and if there was, there really are worse things than being told it’s simple or easy. Second, almost everybody I know will attempt to help you and no, you’re not wasting their time. The same people I was scared to approach in the past are now the same people I call friends and are people I know I can rely on when I need a hand. The SQL Community is full of people that look across the room at eye level with each other . Don’t worry, nobody will belittle you and most are willing to help and welcome you to the community.
</p>
<h2>Walk up and talk to us, Please!</h2>
<p>
Go ahead and take that first step. Join the SQL community now, do not hesitate  to approach anyone, and ask questions. I personally welcome opportunities to make new friends and will be willing to jump in with you on troubleshooting sessions.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>My Recommendations then</h2>
<p>
So where is the SQL Community? How do I find it and jump in?  Truly, it is all around us.  If you look around your area you will probably find SQL Server User Groups formed and meeting regularly.  That is the first step.  Get face to face with other SQL people.  Wait, did we just make a community together?<br />
Other places I recommend and find myself monitoring through the day are listed below.  Special mention should be noted for the still very young Twitter hash tag, #sqlhelp.  If you throw a tweet up on Twitter with the tag #sqlhelp, you will find several replies coming back your way quickly for assistance with SQL Server.  Check out a great example of this in action by David Taylor (<a href="http://dyfhid.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/dyfhid">Twitter</a>), &#8220;<a href="http://dyfhid.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/twitter-sqlhelp-works/">Twitter #sqlhelp WORKS!</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Check the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/sqlserver">MSDN forums on SQL Server</a>.  It is frequented by MVPs, Microsoft team players and many other experts in SQL Server.  Answers very seldom go unanswered.  Follow along on <a href="http://lessthandot.com/">LessThanDot</a> and some of the SQL experts we’ve had the pleasure of being around and writing for us.  <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/">SQL Server Central</a> is a huge repository of SQL Server information.  Sign up for <a href="http://www.databaseweekly.com/">Database Weekly</a>.  The list that goes out weekly of the authors around us is an excellent way to start the week off learning new and different ways of working on SQL Server.  While going through all of these and other locations that you will find regarding SQL Server, take note in the handles and names of the people helping out.  Go to Twitter and see if you can find them.  Start following them!  The information being poured into this tool is unbelievable at times.  If you find yourself following along in a troubleshooting session on Twitter, don’t be afraid to jump in or start your own.  SQL Community has open arms and doesn’t frown upon anyone.  </p>
<p>If you need help getting to Twitter, Brent Ozar (<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/brento">Twitter</a>) took the time to make it easy for all of us, <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2009/12/i-need-sqlhelp/">I Need #SQLHelp!</a></p>
<p>Another resource that is a great starting point was put together on the PASS (Professional Association of SQL Server) web site listed as the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/Community/BlogDirectory.aspx">PASS Blog Directory</a>.  Most of the names listed are on twitter and visit forums actively.</p>
