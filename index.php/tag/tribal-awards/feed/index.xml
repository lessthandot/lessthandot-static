				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like last year, <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/">SQLServerCentral.com</a> and <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/">Simple Talk</a> are hosting the Tribal Awards. In their words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tribal Awards, co-hosted by Simple-Talk and SQLServerCentral, seek to recognize outstanding members of the SQL community. We want to highlight people who are currently leaders due to their writing, speaking, or general community presence.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the previous edition, I was nominated for <em>Best New Community Voice</em>, however this year I am very pleased to announce that this blog has made the final in the category <em>Best Blog of the Year</em>!<br />
It&#8217;s a great honour, especially when you consider the other finalists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brent Ozar</li>
<li>Paul Randal</li>
<li>Thomas LaRock</li>
<li>Pinal Dave</li>
</ul>
<p>Suffice to say I am a little bit of the underdog here. With this blog post, I encourage you to go to the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TribalAwards2014SSC">Tribal Awards voting page</a> and vote for this blog. There are other categories as well, with a lot of community champions featured in them. Please take your time to vote for these people as well, they all deserve it.</p>
<p>A very big thanks for all of the people who nominated this blog, it means a lot to me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve been notified I am a finalist for the category <em>Best New Voice</em> at the <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/blogs/2013/12/08/tribal-awards/">Tribal Awards</a>. These awards are not for some tattoos on your lower back or on your biceps, but rather a collaboration of Simple-Talk and SQLServerCentral to give outstanding community contributors the chance to receive a round of applause by their fellow peers. That’s right, nomination is entirely done by the tech community itself (and I somehow seemed to miss that survey).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have the incredible honour to have been nominated and apparently so enough time to land me a spot in the finals. I’d appreciate it if you, dear reader, could find the time <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TribalAwardsVoting">to vote</a>. Not only for myself (my ego is already big enough), but for other excellent people as well, such as the fine SQLServerCentral forum dwellers like Gail (who needs a new custome), Paul, Jeff, Grant and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers,<br /> Koen</p>
