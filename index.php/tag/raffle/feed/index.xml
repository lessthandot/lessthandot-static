				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winners of the MSDN Ultimate subscriptions are <a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;author=71">Emtucifor</a> and <a href="http://www.shawson.co.uk/codeblog">Shawson</a>. Originally we were going to select the winner based on comments, we also only had one subscription. Then Ted Krueger donated one of his subscriptions, there was only one comment that stood out and it was Emtucifor&#8217;s. The comment is below</p>
<blockquote><p>I have always dreamed of owning my own software company. A few years back I started doing some database development on the side, but then I got married, had a son, and began having some health challenges which together halted what I&#8217;d been doing.</p>
<p>But there is a special opportunity coming to me this Saturday to get back into the swing of things: my wife and son will be leaving the country for six weeks. I had already been planning to devote myself to developing one of many application ideas, but now:</p>
<p>1) I would use MSDN Ultimate Subscription to build a secure server/file transfer/fetching/archiving/processing/reconciling/user worklist managing/cross-platform system (uncannily and quite coincidentally, exactly what is desperately needed at a company I know). It will help other people&#8217;s lives in several ways: filling a need that many companies are bound to have and for a low price (as initially I will need to build market presence more than profit); increasing the number of small software development businesses out there, proving again that it can be done and providing inspiration for the masses; getting a family&#8217;s Dad home so he can spend more time with them. If it helps, I&#8217;ll blog about the development and growth of my application and business.</p>
<p>2) The functionality I would use that is unique to VS Ultimate is Architecture and Modeling. I believe in &#8220;starting the way you mean to finish.&#8221; So even though I&#8217;ll be a one-man shop at first, that means test-driven design, agile development, automated regression testing, version control, good backups, and all the infrastructure needed to hire employees when the time comes without having to change much. I&#8217;ll be eager to add the layer diagramming abilities of VS Ultimate to this mix.</p>
<p>3. Blogs and technical community activity:</p>
<p>/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&#038;author=71<br />
http://stackoverflow.com/users/57611/emtucifor<br />
http://tek-tips.com/userinfo.cfm?member=emtucifor<br />
http://squaredthoughts.blogspot.com/ (a bit out of date but still representative of my work)<br />
not to mention http://forum.lessthandot.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=98</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only did we think that the comment was good but apparently someone else as well, he actually used parts of it as his own in Andy Leonard&#8217;s giveaway here: http://sqlblog.com/blogs/andy_leonard/archive/2010/07/03/a-visual-studio-2010-msdn-seeding-card-giveaway-contest.aspx</p>
<p>We decided to raffle of the other subscription by vote..so I already started to put the polls together. During that time David Taylor left a great comment</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Why do you need this &#8211; Because I am a poor, seriously underpaid SQL Server 2008 DBA/Developer who can&#8217;t even afford VS2010 Pro!<br />
What are you going to build with this &#8211; I am going to build practice apps to learn from, as I am relatively new to development<br />
will it help other people&#8217;s lives? It is my hope that training myself will get me into a job in which I am helping other people.</p>
<p>2) What specific functionality that is only part of Ultimate are you going to use? &#8211; Architecture Explorer</p>
<p>3) You need to have a technical blog and provide the URL to that blog, if you are an active member of the technical community (stackoverflow, msdn forums etc etc) then also include those links. &#8211; http://dyfhid.wordpress.com./ Also, I am the Volunteer Coordinator for PASS&#8217; APplication Development Virtual Chapter, located at http://appdev.sqlpass.org/</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we had a dilemma, do we yank the poll and give the award to David or not? We proceeded with the poll. Wouldn&#8217;t you know it, David won Andy&#8217;s contest, because of that I emailed him and we decided that he wouldn&#8217;t be eligible here.</p>
<p>Here are the results of the final poll: http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=121&amp;t=11550</p>
<p>Congratulations to both winners, hopefully they will let us know in a couple of months if this has indeed made their developer life easier</p>
<p>Congratulations again from all of us at Lessthandot.</p>

<p>We did not include David Taylor because he won this morning at sqlblog: http://sqlblog.com/blogs/andy_leonard/archive/2010/07/09/and-the-winner-is.aspx and he was fine with us taking him off.</p>
<p>Here are the 6 finalist, I picked the top 3 from each group that people had a chance to vote on: http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=121&amp;t=11533 and http://forum.lessthandot.com/posting.php?mode=edit&amp;f=121&amp;p=56403</p>
<p>This vote will end in 3 hours, at noon Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5)<br />
Here are the candidates and their replies</p>
<p><strong>Shawson</strong><br />
1) I will build games with it. I am getting into indie game development with a view to moving from my current profession of web development into games development. I&#8217;m just completing a browser game using just javascript and the new html5 media and canvas elements, to see whats possible in the near future without flash! So i will be using it for c# xna, as well as javascript and html. I also wish to do some work with the new odata stuff, to deal with the highscores, as well as a chance to use the latest iteration of the entity framework. </p>
<p>2) The historical debugger would be awesome, especially when debugging realtime code which is changing all the time, as you see in game loops. I&#8217;m also interested to see the designer tools letting you visually build systems with UML and have the basic structural code generated for you. </p>

1. I need this subscription to help me simplify healthcare-related software. Simpler software is easier to use correctly. Improve record keeping improves lives.<br />
2. Better ALM, Architecture and Modeling, and DB support would help make me a better developer.<br />

1) I am now running my a user group ( http://sqlsocialkent20100818.eventbrite.com/) , so would like to speak with more authority about DataDude and such issues.<br />
2) Intellitrace looks good as do the architecture components.<br />

1. I am working on a startup idea. Currently using ASP.NET MVC 1, VS 2008. Would love to move up to VS 2010 / .NET 4 and latest MVC version. Idea is around helping people find great deals on products/services.</p>
<p>2. I could certainly use the feature packs / architecture / modeling tools and the latest Visual Studio 2010. I&#8217;d also be interested in playing with Expression Studio Ultimate. Any Windows Phone 7 stuff (if available) would be nice to experiment with as well.</p>

1) I&#8217;m currently running VS2010 Premium, but it just lacks the of all the architectural stuff that&#8217;s in the Ultimate version. I&#8217;d use that to build some tooling or VS extension that revolves arround code inspection, code reflection and generations of diagrams from existing assemblies.</p>
<p>2) The architecture and modeling stuff. Also the use of the just released Visualization and Modeling Feature Pack is on my wish-to-use list.</p>

<p>We decided on one of the winners already, for the other winner I decided to pull a Pontius Pilate on you so that nobody can blame me that they didn&#8217;t win&#8230;.yes I know it sounds like a  cop out&#8230;that is because it is&#8230;and this is more fun.</p>
<p>Here is what I did..I picked the 20 best answers and put them in 2 groups of 10. In each group 3 people will advance to a final vote, you can vote for two people. The results of those two polls will be looked at tomorrow morning around 9 AM EST and then a new poll will be created with the final 6 contestants.</p>
<p>Make sure that you look at every person&#8217;s answer, also check their links so that you can decide who should advance.</p>
<p>The group A people can be found here: http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=121&amp;t=11533<br />
The group B people can be found here: http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=121&amp;t=11532</p>
