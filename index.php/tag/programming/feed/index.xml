				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The world of development is an interesting one where creativity comes alive through code to produce wonderful programs that do lots of cool stuff.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Okay that&#8217;s the Wizard of Oz intro over, is it really that rosy?</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It seems the world of development has changed a great deal and gone are the days when you could just be a code cutter (though such roles do exist and are required), it seems a developer has to now master a wide array of skills and do battle with various foes like the Windows Operating System (<em>level 72 elite boss for those that are keeping track&#8230;</em>) as well trying to do their day job (<em>which in itself now consists of different minion roles</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">With the advances in .NET development there are a wide range of Frameworks, Tools and Add-Ons that can be worked with, installed and generally cried over (<em>a black hole in which I have been sucked into, the crying bit&#8230;</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/coders.jpg?mtime=1359936989" alt="Coders" width="282" height="202" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Now I can hear you say, that&#8217;s all good but we don&#8217;t have those problems, we have a <strong>Textbook Development Team</strong> with a <strong>Textbook It Support Team</strong> in a <strong>Textbook Office</strong> but that is not quite the real world and you will often have boundaries between teams becoming thinner or more common now, the lack of resources and/or teams (<em>leaving the task of taking on those roles and their responsibilities up to the individuals in the department and organisation</em>).</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But then the question has to be asked, just how efficient and proficient can you be as an individual, a team and a department if you are spending a percentage of your available resource and effort performing other duties, often to prepare something prior to performing your actual task or after the event where you still need to perform a multitude of other tasks (<em>covering various roles like administration etc.</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">And this is where my hell begins&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;">Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I enjoy the techie element of my role, I feel I fulfil the developer title more fully by being able to flex my many different skills (<em>making me adaptable for almost any occasion</em>), a result of accumulating experience in a wide range of sectors starting from my humble beginnings as an IT Support guy, moving into a System Administration role, sideways across into Application Support, Technical Project Lead, Solution Architecture and back into Software Development in my current role as an Senior .NET Enterprise Developer (</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><em>not Star Trek&#8230;I wish it was, but it&#8217;s not and I have to live with that disappointment for the rest of my career life&#8230;I tried do the Spock hand thing, got strange looks from the others in the developer forum&#8230;</em></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;">).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the company where I work now, my team is fairly self-sufficient and that often means we do a lot of the stuff ourselves (<em>whilst still going through proper channels as required</em>) which is great as it means we can quickly prototype solutions through a Virtual Machine on our PC or install a particular tool we need to perform some task &#8211; all of this means that we generally have control over our own PC&#8217;s (<em>as all developers should&#8230;but they don&#8217;t unfortunately</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But it&#8217;s a double edged sword as I found out the past few days and while being able to administer your own PC&#8217;s and Server&#8217;s is great it can quickly become a bottomless pit that you simply can&#8217;t escape no matter how many Bear Ghryll&#8217;s episodes you have watched (<em>some English guy on the TV that does cool stuff to survive, like James Bond for the wild</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So begins my particular episode&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I have a pretty snazzy developer PC inherited from my predecessor, a rather cool Hewlet Packard Z600 Workstation specced up to the hilt with serious &#8216;Uber&#8217; hardware (<em>dual quad Xeon&#8217;s, stupid amount of memory, SSD&#8217;s, drool&#8230;</em>) and thankfully I have complete control over it (<em>mostly</em>) so I had the chance to configure my PC the way I wanted it to do the development I needed to do.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I have the usual culprits on there, Visual Studio 2010 Premium SP1, MSSQL Server 2008 R2, VMware, lots of useful tools (<em>Notepad++, Red Gate, Solitaire</em>) all running on a Windows 7 Professional 64 bit&#8230;nothing out of the ordinary there I hear you say, ah I haven’t told you about that little evil gremlin called Oracle, more specifically Oracle 64 bit and 32 bit clients on a 64 bit operating system (<em>yes, that combination should cause you to feel nauseous</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The goal was simple, get the latest version of a large .NET Enterprise project, build it, tweak it, break it and glue it back together.  However there was one caveat, I needed to then install the following in some order (<em>mostly like this one</em>):</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Install the Oracle 64 bit Client for Windows</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Install the 64 bit ODAC stuff (<em>for some nice ODACness</em>), the Xcopy version btw</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Install the 32 bit Client (ODT with ODAC)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Simple enough I thought, having virtual zero Oracle skills I was up for the challenge and felt confident I had the knowhow and experience (<em>plus large balls</em>) to deal with any issues that might crop up and like a true techie I refused to read the manual (<em>text file in the case of Oracle products</em>)…I was in for a bumpy ride it seems.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">* It should be noted here, if you do happen to install the 32 bit client first and/or the Oracle Developer Tools and ODAC (32 bit), you will have seriously random Installation problems trying to install Oracle 64 bit Client (<em>the solution is to follow the instructions further down in this post to remove and clean up your PC</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I went ahead and installed the 64 bit Client, in this case I used the client installation that came provided with the Oracle 11g database installation CD (<em>supplied by the tech support guys</em>), selected <strong>Administrator</strong> as the installation type, pointed the installer to where I wanted the files to go, set the Oracle Home directory and went ahead with the installation (<em>no problems here</em>).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/oracle-installer.jpg?mtime=1359936990" alt="Oracle Installer" width="399" height="274" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">All good so far, put my <strong>TNSNAMES.ORA</strong> file into the  <strong>{Oracle_Home}Product11.2.0Client_X64NetworkAdmin</strong> folder, fired up a Command console and used Sqlplus to connect to an Oracle 11g database server that was supplied by the tech support team, worked like a charm.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After doing this I installed the Xcopy version of the 64 bit ODAC libraries and tools which can only be installed by the command prompt so you need to run a command similar to this in the installation directory:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="background-color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">install.bat all c:oracle OracleHome_Client1 </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Or something similar to the above command which should go ahead and install the required ODAC bits into the proper place (<em>you need to ensure you specify the Oracle Home directory</em>).  Again this went fairly smoothly as well with no hick-ups so up next was the 32 bit client and here you need to make sure you install the Oracle Developer Tools with ODAC which includes the 32 bit client otherwise you will experience much pain as I did (<em>where I installed the 32 bit client, then ODAC and other bits which caused no end of pain due to path problems, mismatched versions of dll’s etc</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The above allows you to correctly use PL/SQL Developer (<em>if you have this cool application installed</em>) as long as you remember to go into the <strong>Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Connection</strong> section and set the OCI Library to the correct location (<em>e.g. {oracle_home}product11.2.0client_1oci.dll or client_1binoci.dll depending on your version</em>) and any other application that requires the 32 bit Oracle Client.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Now the above hard work should be adequate to get a working Developer Workstation with both 64 bit and 32 bit Oracle Clients and Developer Tools however there is always a but…what I didn’t tell you was the amount of pain I went through to get the above installation list right, and believe me it was extremely painful and as I have found out after posting this blog page, there a few other client combinations that can work e.g. having a primary 32 bit Oracle Client installation with the developer tools and a 64 bit Instant Client installation (<em>will save this for a future post</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I spent an awfully long time getting my workstation working and when things did go wrong (<em>which they did a lot, just Google the various issues people have had trying to install and use Oracle clients with their Visual Studio developer machines</em>) I barely got any work done which prompted my colleague to say:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>“We have to do so much administration work, just to get to a solution developed and delivered”</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Which got me thinking, this is very true and probably becoming the norm now with modern development, more so in my case due to the nature of the team I am in i.e. we develop lots of bespoke solutions, integration various systems together, sometimes involving small pieces of development to large scale projects.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What I haven’t shared is the nightmare scenario I ended up in with a totally messed up pair of gac’s (<em>32 bit and 64 bit</em>) and problems compiling any of our projects because they all used one combination or another of the Oracle client (<em>mostly 64 bit now</em>).  So if anyone has had this problem here is the proper way to deal with it…</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Open Command Prompt and change to the directory containing your Oracle client installation and run the deinstall.bat batch script:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="background-color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">{oracle_home}product11.2.0Client_X64Deinstalldeinstall.bat</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Once the de-installation (<em>uninstall to you and me…Oracle people…</em>) is complete you need to run the Oracle Universal Installer (<em>semi-cool Java tool…Java is not cool, the app is however</em>).  When this app fires up you have the option to Deinstall any installations on your system:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/oracle-installer-deinstall.jpg?mtime=1359936990" alt="Oracle Deinstall" width="372" height="270" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Select all the products and then click on Remove to uninstall (<em>deinstall</em>) the products:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/oracle-installer-deinstall-inventory.jpg?mtime=1359936991" alt="Inventory" width="150" height="245" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have no issues with the uninstallation of the Oracle Client stuff you will need to go into the Windows Registry to make sure you remove any references to an Oracle installation otherwise your future Oracle Client installation exercises will result in broken installations and more headaches.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Edit the registry (click START &gt; type regedit32) and start with the following registry location:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Find the Oracle Key and delete it, do the same for the HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_USERS (<em>you will need to go through the various sub parent keys and find any Oracle sub Keys and delete them</em>). </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Don&#8217;t forget to clear the gac&#8217;s (both 32 bit and 64 bit), I found this the simplest way of doing it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Start Command Prompt for Visual Studio 32 bit</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Type gacutil /l &gt; c:gac32list.txt</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Open the gac32list.txt file and find the word Oracle</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the Command Prompt window type the following commands: </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">gacutil /u Oracle.DataAccess</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">gacutil /u Oracle.Database.Extensions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">gacutil /u Oracle.Web</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Close the Command Prompt window</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Start Command Prompt for Visual Studio 64 bit</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Repeat the above commands</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Close the Command Prompt window</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This should give you a clean installation and hopefully allow you to get a working installation of the Oracle clients on your .NET Developer Workstation.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So back to the question at hand, just what kind of developer does a developer need to be?  Someone who is comfortable at administering their local, virtual and remote computers?  And just how much effort should be made before you require assistance (<em>and will that not take more effort</em>) but what if you work in an environment where the resources are not available and you have to <strong>“man up”</strong> (<em>so to speak</em>) and take the reins, do you factor that into any and every piece of work and project you do?</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Well in an ideal world you would minimize the effort required for each subsequent piece of work and/or project however you cannot avoid the moments when you will simply have to dig into the trenches and get your hands dirty so be prepared to lose half your estimated time (<em>if not more</em>) battling system incompatibilities, software bugs, assembly hell and those gremlins that keep causing you to see spots on your screen (<em>honest</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Set aside time to climb a difficult mountain and get your hands cut, you will need to work out the many holes in your nice setup and as more and more technical requirements popup don’t expect everything to work well together the first time (<em>you have to integrate your own development environment first</em>). </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So key here is to develop the expertise if you don’t have it at hand, become adaptable but remain honest to yourself (<em>you will have to go through some pain to get to the fruits of your labour</em>).  Use knowledge base tools (<em>Wiki</em>) to record your efforts, communicate your findings with your colleagues and attempt to automate and make reusable as much of what you use as possible.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This will help you better deal with those moments when you have to spend most of your effort on the administration of your development work as appose to the actual developing and as a bonus increase your skills repertoire which every modern developer shouldn’t shy away from (<em>becoming more agile in nature by having a can-do attitude</em>).</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I am going through the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137081073/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0137081073&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sql08-20">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a> by Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob)</p>
<p>In chapter 1, section <em>know your field</em>, a list of artifacts is mentioned that you should know as a programmer. If you don&#8217;t know these things then apparently you suck, so let&#8217;s see how many of these do you know?</p>
<ul>
<li>Parnas Tables</li>
<li>Nassi-Schneiderman Charts</li>
<li>UML</li>
<li>Data Flow Diagram</li>
<li>Structure Charts</li>
<li>Petri Nets</li>
<li>State Transition Diagrams and Tables</li>
<li>Flow Charts</li>
<li>Decision Tables</li>
<li>Tramp Data</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your count? Leave a comment with your count, it will be interesting to see how many people actually know all these things.</p>
<p>I knew only six of these things by name. However when I looked them up I realized that I have used or seen almost all of them, even though I did not know what the correct name was for them</p>
<p>Tramp Data was an interesting one, I did not know that term. Tramp Data is data which is passed from one function to another, and not used by the first function.</p>
<p>What do you think, should all programmers know all of these artifacts?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feelings about programming katas tend to fall into one of 3 buckets; disdain, indifference, or appreciation. The indifferent crowd generally doesn&#8217;t see what you learn from repeating the same coding exercise, while the disdainful crowd feels the same way, but at a much louder (and of course disdainful) volume. That leaves the group that feel there is value in repetitively coding the same exercise or coding numerous small code examples.</p>
<p>I was in the indifferent group, but then I tried it.</p>
<h2>Where I Started</h2>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/clock.png" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px" /></p>
<p>After finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137081073" title="The Clean Coder at Amazon">The Clean Coder</a> recently, I decided to give this kata thing a try. I started out with a fairly simple problem in a language I was comfortable with and spent 15-30 minutes each night trying a different variant or constraint. What I found was that even the act of setting up for a kata was a learning experience, in one case learning an entirely new unit test framework before I could even begin.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple weeks and I think this is becoming a regular part of my ongoing development. I&#8217;ve even taken to synching my local mercurial repositories up to <a href="http://bitbucket.org/tarwn" title="Go to my BitBucket account">my BitBucket account</a> so that others can take advantage of the pre-setup projects and test scenarios. (I haven&#8217;t quite embraced the throw-away aspect yet, but I suspect I won&#8217;t be keeping all of my repetitive attempts.)</p>
<p>In the past several weeks I&#8217;ve gained a lot more practice with mercurial, played with some concepts in C# (like Continuation Passing Style), and started digging into unit testing JavaScript. I&#8217;ve learned markdown simply by spending an hour or two formatting a series of text documents (an uninspired exercise, I&#8217;ll admit) and .. well, for the not much time investment I can already see that this will be a good habit to add.</p>
<h2>Why (or How) it Works</h2>
<p>So why, then, do people do this? Obviously it takes time to write a program, no matter how small. <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Robert C. Martin</a>, author of The Clean Coder above, swears by this practice. Jeff Atwood is another who <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/the-ultimate-code-kata.html">wrote about katas</a>. Dave Thomas (first kata link below) introduced the term as co-author of The Pragmatic Programmer. </p>
<p>But where is the value in repeating a simple exercise?</p>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The first thing that struck me about code katas is their similarity to forum questions the LTD group used to hijack, back in the day. Someone would come up with a perfectly reasonable solution to a somewhat reasonable problem, then 2 or 3 of us would turn it into a 30 reply post, each trying to find a shorter, faster, whackier, whatever-er method of solving the same problem. In fact, the reason I learned how to use python and perl in classic ASP web pages was due to challenges like this.</p>
<p>The value of short, varied approaches is it forces us to stretch our knowledge of a language or syntax. Playing with constraints (performance, code length, memory limits, etc) help us explore more about a language or technology and choosing a short exercise as a base means we spend most of our time in that exploration, rather than in the act of retyping a solution or having to build a large structure to work with.</p>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/Scores2.png" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px" /></p>
<p>By selecting a fairly simple problem, we can choose to focus on any other aspect of programming that we want. Besides introducing rules or constraints to make the program more challenging, we can also use repetition of a simple, known problem to better get to know our tools or learn new supporting tools. Examples include improving use of keyboard shortcuts, trying out methods like TDD, and training ourselves on new habits or standards. By working on something we already know the answer to, we are free to play with the aspects of how we get to that answer.</p>
<h3>No Loss</h3>
<p>The last benefit to a programming kata is we can throw it away when we&#8217;re done or even stop it halfway and simply delete it. Whatever aspect we have chosen to focus on or challenge ourselves with, this is still a small bit of practice code. Rather than trying to learn something new with a piece of code we will eventually have to support, we can play in a sandbox and put it away when we&#8217;re done.</p>
<h2>Where Can You Start</h2>
<p>So, if you wanted to try this out, where could you start?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">CodeKata.PragProg.com</a> &#8211; Dave Thomas has listed 21 programming and non-programming exercises</li>
<li>Forums &#8211; Find a forum question that requires more than 5 lines of code for an answer. Write it, reinvent it, mix, repeat</li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue">Coding Dojo</a> &#8211; A catalog of 23 katas</li>
<li><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> &#8211; a series of challenging math problems that make excellent practice problems</li>
<li><a href="http://topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> &#8211; Though it exists as a programming competition, the sample and practice problems at TopCoder make good katas (if you can get the crash-friendly interface to work and find them, that is)</li>
<li>Blogging &#8211; Writing about a topic forces us to explore and better define or communicate it</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to start is to pick something you feel like you can finish in 15-30 minutes and try to do a variant of it every day or two. If you feel like you&#8217;re not getting any value out of it after a week or two, you can stop; your time investment has been low. If you do start seeing some value in it, though, you have another tool for keeping your skills relevant and sharp.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the way back in 2010 Google realized that JavaScript is a dead end programming language.</p>
<p>Here is what was posted on the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/uro3jtoitlmq6x7t">com.googlegroups.google-caja-discuss</a> list</p>
<blockquote><p>Javascript has fundamental flaws that cannot be fixed merely by evolving the<br />
language.  We&#8217;ll adopt a two-pronged strategy for the future of Javascript:</p>
<p>   &#8211; Harmony (low risk/low reward): continue working in conjunction with<br />
   TC39 (the EcmaScript standards body) to evolve Javascript<br />
   &#8211; Dash (high risk/high reward): Develop a new language (called Dash) that<br />
   aims to maintain the dynamic nature of Javascript but have a better<br />
   performance profile and be amenable to tooling for large projects. Push for<br />
   Dash to become an open standard and be adopted by other browsers. Developers<br />
   using Dash tooling will be able to use a cross-compiler to target Javascript<br />
   for browsers that do not support Dash natively.</p></blockquote>
<p>A new language will be announced at the goto conference named Dart, the keynote will be:  <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/presentation/Opening%20Keynote:%20Dart,%20a%20new%20programming%20language%20for%20structured%20web%20programming">Opening Keynote: Dart, a new programming language for structured web programming</a></p>
<p>Assuming that Dash is now called Dart, here is what it is supposed to do, again according to the posting on the com.googlegroups.google-caja-discuss list</p>
<blockquote><p>Dash is the leapfrog effort that is designed to be a clean break from<br />
Javascript.  It will seek to keep the parts that have made the Internet so<br />
successful, but fill in holes everyone agrees it has.</p>
<p>Dash is designed with three perspectives in mind:</p>
<p>   &#8211; Performance &#8212; Dash is designed with performance characteristics in<br />
   mind, so that it is possible to create VMs that do not have the performance<br />
   problems that all EcmaScript VMs must have.<br />
   &#8211; Developer Usability &#8212; Dash is designed to keep the dynamic,<br />
   easy-to-get-started, no-compile nature of Javascript that has made the web<br />
   platform the clear winner for hobbyist developers.<br />
   &#8211; Ability to be Tooled &#8212; Dash is designed to be more easily tooled (e.g.<br />
   with optional types) for large-scale projects that require<br />
   code-comprehension features such as refactoring and finding callsites.<br />
    Dash, however, does not require tooling to be effective&#8211;small-scale<br />
   developers may still be satisfied with a text editor.</p>
<p>Dash is also designed to be securable, where that ability does not seriously<br />
conflict with the three main goals.</p>
<p>Dash will be designed to be consumed in a number of locations:</p>
<p>   &#8211; Browser VM &#8212; Our aspiration is that Dash will ultimately be a viable<br />
   substitute for Javascript as the native client-side language of choice<br />
   across all browsers.<br />
   &#8211; Front-end Server &#8212; Dash will be designed as a language that can be<br />
   used server-side for things up to the size of Google-scale Front Ends.  This<br />
   will allow large scale applications to unify on a single language for client<br />
   and front end code.<br />
   &#8211; Dash Cross Compiler &#8212; Dash will be designed so that a large subset of<br />
   it can be compiled to target legacy Javascript platforms so teams that<br />
   commit to using Dash do not have to seriously limit their reach.  Platforms<br />
   that have a Dash VM can operate on the original Dash code without<br />
   translation and take advantage of the increased performance.  One of the<br />
   ways we will evolve Harmony is to be a better target for such compiled Dash<br />
   code.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far we don&#8217;t know much about this new language except for what they say about Dash, we can assume that it will address some of the points that were posted in the list which I shared in this post earlier</p>
<p>Even if this new language is better than JavaScript will all the other browser vendors be on board? Remember that Google launched the <a href="http://golang.org/">Go language</a> last year, what happened to that?</p>
<p>I am skeptical about all of this but of course I could be dead wrong</p>
<p>Time will tell&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was asked on twitter recently and I gave the answer there. I decided to write a blog post about this because I can use over 140 charaters here instead.<br />
You will see the Cannot resolve collation conflict for equal to operation error when you try to join 2 tables. let&#8217;s take a look at what we need to do to resolve this. First create and populate these two tables</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1

13
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">use</span> tempdb
go
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span class="kw1">create</span> <span class="kw1">table</span> Test <span class="br0">&#40;</span>SomeColumn <span class="kw1">varchar</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="nu0">100</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> not null<span class="br0">&#41;</span>
<span class="kw1">insert</span> Test <span class="kw1">values</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'bla'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>
<span class="kw1">insert</span> Test <span class="kw1">values</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'test'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span class="kw1">create</span> <span class="kw1">table</span> Test2 <span class="br0">&#40;</span>SomeColumn <span class="kw1">varchar</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="nu0">100</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> <span class="kw1">collate</span> Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI not null<span class="br0">&#41;</span>
<span class="kw1">insert</span> Test2 <span class="kw1">values</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'Niño'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>
<span class="kw1">insert</span> Test2 <span class="kw1">values</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'bla'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">use tempdb
go



create table Test (SomeColumn varchar(100) not null)
insert Test values('bla')
insert Test values('test')


create table Test2 (SomeColumn varchar(100) collate Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI not null)
insert Test2 values('Niño')
insert Test2 values('bla')</pre></div></div>

<p>Now run the following join between the Test and Test2 tables</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> <span class="sy0">*</span> <span class="kw1">from</span> Test t1
join Test2 t2 <span class="kw1">on</span> t1.<span class="me1">SomeColumn</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> t2.<span class="me1">SomeColumn</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select * from Test t1
join Test2 t2 on t1.SomeColumn = t2.SomeColumn</pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the error you will get</p>
<p><strong>Server: Msg 446, Level 16, State 9, Line 1<br />
Cannot resolve collation conflict for equal to operation.</strong></p>
<p>To quickly fix this you can use collate in your SQL, you have to make sure that the collation is the same on both columns. So you either add the collate with the collation of the column in test2 to the column in the test table or vice-versa. Here is one example</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> <span class="sy0">*</span> <span class="kw1">from</span> Test t1
join Test2 t2 <span class="kw1">on</span> t1.<span class="me1">SomeColumn</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> t2.<span class="me1">SomeColumn</span> <span class="kw1">collate</span> Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select * from Test t1
join Test2 t2 on t1.SomeColumn = t2.SomeColumn collate Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI</pre></div></div>

<p>You can also apply collate on the other column&#8230;first we need to know what the default was in your database. We can use the ANSI information_schema.columns view to get this info, we need to use the collation_name column. Run the following query to grab it</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> column_name,collation_name
<span class="kw1">from</span> information_schema.<span class="me1">columns</span>
<span class="kw1">where</span> table_name <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="st0">'test'</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select column_name,collation_name
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'test'</pre></div></div>

<p>In my case it is SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS, now the query becomes the following</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> <span class="sy0">*</span> <span class="kw1">from</span> Test t1
join Test2 t2 <span class="kw1">on</span> t1.<span class="me1">SomeColumn</span> <span class="kw1">collate</span> SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS <span class="sy0">=</span> t2.<span class="me1">SomeColumn</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select * from Test t1
join Test2 t2 on t1.SomeColumn collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS = t2.SomeColumn</pre></div></div>

<p>Just for fun let&#8217;s see what the collation is for the column in the Test2 table</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> column_name,collation_name
<span class="kw1">from</span> information_schema.<span class="me1">columns</span>
<span class="kw1">where</span> table_name <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="st0">'Test2'</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select column_name,collation_name
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'Test2'</pre></div></div>

<p>As expected it is Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI</p>
<p>You can use the ::fn_helpcollations()function which returns a list of all the collations supported by SQL Server to get more info about the collation</p>
<p>Run the following query (and yes :: is not a typo)</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>

<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select * from ::fn_helpcollations()
where name ='Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI'</pre></div></div>

<p>The query returns the following description for Traditional_Spanish_CI_AI&#8217;</p>
<p>Traditional-Spanish, case-insensitive, accent-insensitive, kanatype-insensitive, width-insensitive</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of is that when using collate it needs to do a conversion so you might get performance problems&#8230;make sure to check those execution plans.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help some person when dealing with this in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHESS is an automated tool from Microsoft Research for finding errors in multithreaded software by systematic exploration of thread schedules. It finds errors, such as data-races, deadlocks, hangs, and data-corruption induced access violations, that are extremely hard to find with current testing tools. Once CHESS locates an error, it provides a fully repeatable execution of the program leading to the error, thus greatly aiding the debugging process. In addition, CHESS provides a valuable and novel notion of test coverage suitable for multithreaded programs. CHESS can use existing concurrent test cases and is therefore easy to deploy. Both developers and testers should find CHESS useful.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t exist and that is correct since it&#8217;s a local temp table not a global temp table </p>

<p>And yes this time it does exist since it&#8217;s a global table</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Straight from the man himself comes this statement posted in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.sqlserver.programming/browse_thread/thread/b29389050253df78/87d7c1b73e60e41d#87d7c1b73e60e41d">microsoft.public.sqlserver.programming forum</a>: &#8220;<em>You need to read ISO-11179 so you use proper data element names. You<br />
actually had &#8220;tbl-&#8220;on the table names! Sometimes &#8220;id&#8221; id a<br />
prefix and sometimes it is a postfix.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course you know who I am talking about? No? Joe Celko of course.  So what is ISO-11179?</p>
<p>The 11179 standard is a multipart standard that includes the following parts:</p>
<p><a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-1">11179-1</a><br />
<strong>Part 1: Framework</strong>, introduces and discusses fundamental ideas of data elements, value domains, data element concepts, conceptual domains, and classification schemes essential to the understanding of this set of standards and provides the context for associating the individual parts of ISO/IEC 11179.</p>
<p><a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-2">11179-2</a><br />
<strong>Part 2: Classification</strong>, provides a conceptual model for managing classification schemes. There are many structures used to organize classification schemes and there are many subject matter areas that classification schemes describe. So, this Part also provides a two-faceted classification for classification schemes themselves.</p>
<p><a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-3">11179-3</a><br />
<strong>Part 3: Registry Metamodel and Basic Attributes</strong>, specifies a conceptual model for a metadata registry. It is limited to a set of basic attributes for data elements, data element concepts, value domains, conceptual domains, classification schemes, and other related classes, called administered items. The basic attributes specified for data elements in ISO/IEC 11179-3:1994 are provided in this revision.</p>
<p><a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-4">11179-4</a><br />
<strong>Part 4: Formulation of Data Definitions,</strong> provides guidance on how to develop unambiguous data definitions. A number of specific rules and guidelines are presented in ISO/IEC 11179-4 that specify exactly how a data definition should be formed. A precise, well-formed definition is one of the most critical requirements for shared understanding of an administered item; well-formed definitions are imperative for the exchange of information. Only if every user has a common and exact understanding of the data item can it be exchanged trouble-free.</p>
<p><a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-5">11179-5</a><br />
<strong>Part 5: Naming and Identification Principles</strong>, provides guidance for the identification of administered items. Identification is a broad term for designating, or identifying, a particular data item. Identification can be accomplished in various ways, depending upon the use of the identifier. Identification includes the assignment of numerical identifiers that have no inherent meanings to humans; icons (graphic symbols to which meaning has been assigned); and names with embedded meaning, usually for human understanding, that are associated with the data item&#8217;s definition and value domain.</p>
<p><a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-6">11179-6</a><br />
<strong>Part 6: Registration</strong>, provides instruction on how a registration applicant may register a data item with a central Registration Authority and the allocation of unique identifiers for each data item. Maintenance of administered items already registered is also specified in this document.</p>
<p>The one that deals with  naming conventions is <a href="http://metadata-standards.org/11179/#11179-5">11179-5</a> The link will point to a zip file which has a pdf file in it. The TOC of this pdf file is below</p>
<p>Contents<br />
Foreword<br />
1 Scope<br />
2 Normative references<br />
3 Terms and definitions<br />
4 Data Identifiers within a registry<br />
5 Identification<br />
6 Names<br />
6.1 Names in a registry<br />
6.2 Naming conventions<br />
7 Development of naming conventions<br />
7.1 Introduction<br />
7.2 Scope principle<br />
7.3 Authority principle<br />
7.4 Semantic principle<br />
7.5 Syntactic principle<br />
7.6 Lexical principle<br />
7.7 Uniqueness principle<br />
Annex A (informative) Example naming conventions for names within an MDR registry<br />
Annex B (informative) Example naming conventions for Asian languages</p>
<p>So check it out and hopefully you and your team can adapt a common naming conventions instead of having things named like employee_address, EmployeeAddress, employeeAddress and tblEmployeeAddress.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Which books should you read/buy when you are a programmer? I have listed 5 books that have helped me a lot. The books that I have chosen are not specific to any language although some of the books have examples in one language only. Design Patterns has examples in smalltalk and C++ but since the code is not very complicated you should have no problem converting it to your language of choice. I have included links to sample chapters for the books where I could find them. For some of the books I have also provided links to the author&#8217;s site; some of them have additional material so that you can look at that. I have also provided Amazon links so that you can read reviews. All of these books are rated 4 stars or higher. I have also provided alternate books if I felt that there were more choices for the same subject</p>

</strong>This book will change the way you think about and working with exisiting code. It&#8217;ll teach you that changing/modifying software is a fact of life. Martin Fowler does a awesome job of describing how to improve the design of existing code by performing various refactorings. Various design patterns are mentioned throughout the text, that is another reason why the design patterns book is so important</p>
<p>Sample Chapter: <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/content/images/0201485672/samplechapter/chap4.html">Refactoring, a First Example</a></p>

UML has grown. A few years ago, when UML was just getting accepted, a book on how to use it would have been much thinner. But the successful broad uptake of UML led to its semantic notation being expanded. What the authors give us here is a thorough exposition of UML 2.0 and how to use it. It also goes into the Unified Process for running a project, and how this can be documented in UML</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Source Analysis for C# has been announced. Here is what I found on the Microsoft site:<br />
<blockquote>This tool is known internally within Microsoft as StyleCop, and has been used for many years now to help teams enforce a common set of best practices for layout, readability, maintainability, and documentation of C# source code.</p>
<p>Source Analysis is similar in many ways to Microsoft Code Analysis (specifically FxCop), but there are some important distinctions. FxCop performs its analysis on compiled binaries, while Source Analysis analyzes the source code directly. For this reason, Code Analysis focuses more on the design of the code, while Source Analysis focuses on layout, readability and documentation. Most of that information is stripped away during the compilation process, and thus cannot be analyzed by FxCop.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Source Analysis is to allow you to produce elegant, consistent code that your team members and others who view your code will find highly readable. </p></blockquote>
<p>More info can be found here: http://blogs.msdn.com/sourceanalysis/<br />
Source Analysis for C# can be downloaded here: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=sourceanalysis.</p>
