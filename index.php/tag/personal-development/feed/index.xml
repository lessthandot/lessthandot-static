				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a post I wanted to write for a while but I just didn&#8217;t want my students to think I was visioning them. So if you are one of my students, no it&#8217;s not about you but I have to write this because almost every class I teach I have a student who does not meet the prerequisites, is too experienced or had other expectations of the course.<br />
When teaching at a Microsoft Learning Partner Center I usually use the standard Microsoft Official Curriculum courses so there is plenty information about them on the internet.
<div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elycefeliz/3262326159/"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/axel8s/ChooseTrain1.jpg?mtime=1337691082" width="647" height="584" /></a></div>
<p>First there is the Partner Centers&#8217; website where you can book the training, they all list the official numbers and most of them have also the complete description. Otherwise you can check the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft Learning site</a>. Fill in the course number and make sure you read the Course Details and Prerequisites! If you don&#8217;t match the prerequisites for let&#8217;s say 60% and don&#8217;t think <i>&#8220;hmm interesting&#8221;</i> for 75% of the chapters, maybe this is not the ideal training for you.</p>
<p>What happens when you&#8217;re in the &#8220;wrong training&#8221;?<br />
Well it depends, if you don&#8217;t meet the prerequisites, you&#8217;ll lose interest, get bored, and miss some essential information so you completely can&#8217;t follow anymore,&#8230; You just wasted you&#8217;re time and money. The same happens when you already have too much knowledge. It&#8217;s good that you have some working experience before you come follow a course. But if you work for 5 years with the previous release you shouldn&#8217;t follow the complete basic course of the next release. You will get the same result.<br />
On the other hand you will also ask a lot of questions, because you don&#8217;t know how to get the exercises to work or because you can ask all the exceptions you ran into the last 5 years to the teachers. In both scenario&#8217;s you will annoy you&#8217;re co-students for slowing down they&#8217;re training experience, taking too much teacher time and so on.<br />
As a teacher I don&#8217;t mind getting all these extra questions, beginner or advanced. But I have to make sure that the majority of the class gets what they paid for so at some point I might have to disappoint you.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re going to take a training, make sure you look up the available information and if you&#8217;re still in doubt. Just mail or call the Education Center. They&#8217;re happy to help you find the training that meets your expectations.</p>
