				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Java Training Day 1<br />
&#8212;<br />
Today is day one of the Java class I am taking this week. I am just dumping some of the stuff that I am hearing about, some of the stuff I might already know.<br />
Java is a general purpose language, it is interperted, output is bytecode, you need to have a Java Virtual Machine on the target machine in order to run a Java program.<br />
A Java file gets compiled to a system-neutral format which is a class file and gets a .class extension, this is compressed and not really human readable</p>
<p>Classes are organized in a group called a package, a package is very similar to a .net namespace. You use this so that you don&#8217;t get collisions if you have two classes with the same name.</p>
<p>You use javadoc to generate standard formatted documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Java community process(JCP)</strong><br />
Formal community-driven process to drive the Java standard, the iste is http://jcp.org/</p>
<p>Deprecate, use annotation and then when you compile your class, you will get a warning so that you will know that you will need to rewrite that piece of the code.</p>
<p>Java is case sensitive, all reserved java keywords are lowercase</p>
<p>In a class the main routine is the start of a program<br />
The main routine will look like this</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) {&#8230;&#8230;.}</p>
<p>A java source file has to end in  .java, for example  MyClass.java this will produce a file called MyClass.class. you can&#8217;t have more than one public class in a source file, you cannot have partial classes like in .net either.</p>
<p>Java runs on top of the JVM, the JVM is different per operating system. No need to recompile Java&#8230;Write once run everywhere&#8230;.some people like to say write once&#8230;debug everywhere  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Java versions and flavors</strong><br />
Java 1.0, 1.1<br />
Java 2 	1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5<br />
Java 5  also sometimes called 1.5, 1.5 is when they shifted to integers again<br />
Java 6<br />
Java 7</p>
<p>The different flavors of Java and their old and new names<br />
J2SE  	Java SE<br />
J2EE	Java EE<br />
J2ME	Java ME</p>
<p><strong>Base libraries to provide common functionality</strong><br />
Here are just some of them</p>
<p>java.lang<br />
java.lang contains fundamental classes and interfaces closely tied to the language and runtime system.</p>
<p>java.io/java.nio/java.net<br />
I/O and networking access the platform file system, and more generally networks through the java.io, java.nio and java.net packages. </p>
<p>java.math<br />
Mathematics package: java.math provides mathematical expressions and evaluation, as well as arbitrary-precision decimal and integer number datatypes.</p>
<p>java.text<br />
Text: java.text deals with text, dates, numbers, and messages.</p>
<p>javax.crypto<br />
Security is provided by java.security and encryption services are provided by javax.crypto.</p>
<p>java.sql<br />
Databases: access to SQL databases via java.sql</p>
<p>java.beans<br />
Java Beans: java.beans provides ways to manipulate reusable components.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Java Software</strong><br />
Class Libraries<br />
Standalone Java<br />
Applets<br />
Servlets, JSP and tag libraries<br />
Enterprise Java Beans</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Application Servers</strong><br />
Here are a couple of Java Enterprise Application Servers and their vendors<br />
GlassFish	Oracle/Sun<br />
Weblogic	Oracle/BEA<br />
Webshere	IBM<br />
JBoss		Red Hat</p>
<p><strong>Environment variables</strong><br />
Oh how I used to hate dealing with these variables, stuff wouldn&#8217;t work if this wasn&#8217;t setup correctly<br />
There are a couple of environment variables that you need</p>
<p><strong>JAVA_HOME</strong><br />
This will be use by the tools in the JDK</p>
<p><strong>PATH</strong><br />
This is used by the operating system to find the compiler and other programs, add the/bin directory</p>
<p><strong>CLASSPATH</strong><br />
This is used by the Java Virtual Machine to find application specific classes at compile as well as run time</p>
<p><strong>JDK Bin directory</strong><br />
THe JDK Bin directory holds all the programs used by the JDK to do what is needed for Java to function<br />
There are programs to compile java, to run java, to create JAR files, to create javadoc documentation files etc etc<br />
Mine is installed here C:Program FilesJavajdk1.7.0_07bin</p>
<p>Here is screenshot of my directory with some of those programs</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/JavaBinDirectory.PNG?mtime=1353948732"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/JavaBinDirectory.PNG?mtime=1353948732" width="795" height="635" /></a></div>
<p>There is something called jvisualvm.exe, this is know as Java VisualVM, from the Oracle documentation: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jvisualvm.html<br />
Java VisualVM is an intuitive graphical user interface that provides detailed information about Java technology-based applications (Java applications) while they are running on a given Java Virtual Machine (JVM*). The name Java VisualVM comes from the fact that Java VisualVM provides information about the JVM software visually.</p>
<p>Java VisualVM combines several monitoring, troubleshooting, and profiling utilities into a single tool. For example, most of the functionality offered by the standalone tools jmap, jinfo, jstat and jstack have been integrated into Java VisualVM. Other functionalities, such as some of those offered by the JConsole tool, can be added as optional plug-ins.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the tool in action while running against Eclipse</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/VisualVMMonitor.PNG?mtime=1353948863"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/VisualVMMonitor.PNG?mtime=1353948863" width="929" height="579" /></a></div>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/VisualVMThreads.PNG?mtime=1353948850"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/VisualVMThreads.PNG?mtime=1353948850" width="919" height="581" /></a></div>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/VisualVMThreadsTable.PNG?mtime=1353948837"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/EnterpriseDev/VisualVMThreadsTable.PNG?mtime=1353948837" width="930" height="594" /></a></div>
<p>Always include . as part of the classpath, this ensure that the current directory is searched in case of a default package</p>
<p><strong>JAR</strong><br />
Java Archive, this is an archived file holding all the classes and a manifest describing what is in the archive</p>
<p>There are related files that are used based on the type of application, here is what info wikipedia has listed</p>
<p>WAR (Web application archive) files, also Java archives, store XML files, Java classes, JavaServer Pages and other objects for Web Applications.<br />
RAR (resource adapter archive) files (not to be confused with the RAR file format), also Java archives, store XML files, Java classes and other objects for J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) applications.<br />
EAR (enterprise archive) files provide composite Java archives which combine XML files, Java classes and other objects including JAR, WAR and RAR Java archive files for Enterprise Applications.<br />
SAR (service archive) is similar to EAR. It provides a service.xml file and accompanying JAR files.<br />
APK (Android Application Package), a variant of the Java archive format, is used for Android applications.[3]</p>
<p>We compiled and ran some programs from the command line, it is amazing how many people have problems with the path and classpath variables to get it to work&#8230;but we all did and now we are allowed to use Eclipese or Netbeans instead</p>
<p><strong>Javadoc comments</strong><br />
We looked at how to do javadoc comments, basically the first line has to start with /**</p>
<p>There are also tags that you can use, it is recommended to use this order</p>
<p>@author (classes and interfaces only, required)<br />
@version (classes and interfaces only, required. See footnote 1)<br />
@param (methods and constructors only)<br />
@return (methods only)<br />
@exception (@throws is a synonym added in Javadoc 1.2)<br />
@see<br />
@since<br />
@serial (or @serialField or @serialData)<br />
@deprecated (see How and When To Deprecate APIs)</p>

    public void finalize() {

}</pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Identifiers</strong><br />
Can have letters and numbers, cannot begin with a digit</p>
<p>The reason most programming language don&#8217;t allow identifiers to start with a digit is simple</p>
<p>int 6;<br />
6=5;</p>
<p>See that? Since an identifier can be 1 character, you could create something named 5 or 6 or even 256, this rule prevents you doing such stuff</p>
<p>Variables can me made constant by using the final keyword for example</p>
<p>final int MAX_VALUE = 40;</p>
<p>You can also do this<br />
final int BOILING_POINT;<br />
BOILING_POINT; = 100;</p>
<p>Once you assign the value, you can&#8217;t change BOILING_POINT anymore</p>
<p>We learned about scope and learned that depending on where the variable is declared, it might not be visible outside of the block, this is the same as in other languages (local variables)</p>
<p>When you want to have only one copy of a class variable, make it static, then if you instatiate 100 classes they all point to the same variable instead of having 100 variables in memory<br />
Static variables are available to use as soon as a class is loaded</p>
<p>Brain fried&#8230;&#8230;time to go&#8230;&#8230;..  back tomorrow</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrjoro/22752982/" title="Java Logo by mrjoro, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/17/22752982_28bfc98f68_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Java Logo" /></a></p>
<p>This week eleven coworkers and myself will be in Java training for most of the time, I haven&#8217;t touched Java since 2001. I did a bunch of research over the 4 day weekend to get a little head start.</p>
<p>I installed Netbeans and Eclipse to see how they are different<br />
I played around with Tapestry and took a look at Struts<br />
I used JUnit to write a couple of tests<br />
I installed Maven and used that to bring down the sample Tapestry project<br />
I installed and configured HyperSQL (with sa and blank password&#8230;  ouch!!!)</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are a whole lot of things that I need to know, twelve years ago none of this stuff existed. I also seems to me that the language itself hasn&#8217;t changed so much compared to C#. I might also take a look at Scala down the road, some of that stuff seems interesting. </p>
<p>When I used Java in 2000 and 2001 it was primarily to do JSP development. The main project at that time was converting a ColdFusion site to JSP. The IDE that we used at that time was Kawa, we also gave Visual Cafe a spin. I must say that the IDE is much much better than what existed twelve years ago. Eclipse has a robust plugin system and computers have advanced in speed over the past twelve years so that Java apps don&#8217;t feels slow on the desktop anymore</p>
<p>Over the next five days, I will blog about what I did and learned, I will also probably put some stuff on our wiki so that I can have it as a reference/cheat sheet</p>
<p>Here is my question to you&#8230;..What are some of your favorite resources for Java and the Java ecosystem? I am looking for blogs to subscribe to, people to follow on twitter, if you have a favorite Java book then tell me about it. My favorite books from 2001 were Core Java, Volume I and II, I am happy to see that the 9th edition is coming out on December 10th: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137081898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0137081898&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sql08-20">Core Java Volume I&#8211;Fundamentals (9th Edition) (Core Series)</a>. If you know of any good podcasts then tell me about those as well</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog will demonstrate the steps to generate a Web Service Client and test JSP files in Eclipse. Finally, it will show a basic JSP example which uses the generated client to call a remote Web Service.</p>
<h2>Setup Tomcat</h2>
<p>Download and extract <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi">Tomcat 6.0</a>. If you&#8217;re using Ubuntu and want to use the system installed tomcat, follow <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8541057">these instructions</a>.</p>
<h2>Create an Eclipse Project</h2>
<p>Open Eclipse and create a new Dynamic Web Project:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/robearl/DynamicWebProject.png" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>Give your project a name (JSPWSClient will do) and click &#8220;New&#8221; to add a New Server Runtime Environment. Select Apache Tomcat v6.0 and locate the directory you extracted to earlier. </p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/robearl/Tomcat.png" alt="" title="" /></p>
<h2>Create Web Service Client</h2>
<p>The client will use the Local Time Web Service from http://ripedevelopment.com/testService.aspx. Set the Service definition for the client to http://www.ripedevelopment.com/webservices/LocalTime.asmx?WSDL and drag the slider on the left to the top (Test Client). </p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/robearl/WebServiceClient.png" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>If the server isn&#8217;t already running the wizard will prompt you to &#8220;Start server&#8221;, do this and, when prompted to generate a Web Service Client Test, accept the defaults to use Web Service Sample JSPs.</p>
<p>Eclipse will then generate a Web Service client and sample JSP files to test it. Once they are generated Eclipse will open the sample JSP client. Using this page the service methods can be tested to ensure connectivity with the service. Examining the source of these files in Project->WebContent->sampleLocalTimeSoapProxy can show us the methods we need to use. </p>
<p>Below is an example JSP file which will call the Web Service Client and lookup the current time in New York.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Corp. today announced the availability of Silverlight 2, one of the industry&#8217;s most comprehensive and powerful solutions for the creation and delivery of applications and media experiences through a Web browser. Silverlight 2 delivers a wide range of new features and tools that enable designers and developers to better collaborate while creating more accessible, more discoverable and more secure user experiences.<br />
Microsoft also announced further support of open source communities by funding advanced Silverlight development capabilities with the Eclipse Foundation’s integrated development environment (IDE) and by providing new controls to developers with the Silverlight Control Pack (SCP) under the Microsoft Permissive License.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We launched Silverlight just over a year ago, and already one in four consumers worldwide has access to a computer with Silverlight already installed,” said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president of the .NET Developer Division at Microsoft. “Silverlight represents a radical improvement in the way developers and designers build applications on the Web. This release will further accelerate our efforts to make Silverlight, Visual Studio and Microsoft Expression Studio the preeminent solutions for the creation and delivery of media and rich Internet application experiences.”<br />
Silverlight adoption continues to grow rapidly, with penetration in some countries approaching 50 percent and a growing ecosystem that includes more than 150 partners and tens of thousands of applications. During the 17 days of the 2008 Olympics Games in Beijing, NBCOlympics.com, powered by Silverlight, had more than 50 million unique visitors, resulting in 1.3 billion page views, 70 million video streams and 600 million minutes of video watched, increasing the average time on the site (from 3 minutes to 27 minutes) and Silverlight market penetration in the U.S. by more than 30 percent. Broadcasters in France (France Televisions SA), the Netherlands (NOS), Russia (Sportbox.ru) and Italy (RAI) also chose Silverlight to deliver Olympics coverage online. In addition, leading companies such as CBS College Sports, Blockbuster Inc., Hard Rock Cafe International Inc., Yahoo! Japan, AOL LLC, Toyota Motor Corp., HSN Inc. and Tencent Inc. are building their next-generation experiences using Silverlight.<br />
“CBS College Sports Network streams more than 20,000 hours of live content annually for our 150-plus college and university official athletic partners, so we demand that our video player environment be both consumer friendly and robust,” said Tom Buffolano, general manager and vice president, Digital Programming and Subscription, CBS Interactive-Sports. “Silverlight was the perfect choice to help develop and power our new, exclusive online collegiate sports experience, as it features the best price and performance of any streaming media solution on the market today. Silverlight also gives us the most flexibility in expanding the product in the future as we develop embeddable players and mobile platforms and explore new advertising integration opportunities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft announced plans to support additional tools for developing Silverlight applications by providing funding to Soyatec, a France-based IT solutions provider and Eclipse Foundation member, to lead a project to integrate advanced Silverlight development capabilities into the Eclipse IDE. Soyatec plans to release the project under the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 on SourceForge and submit it to the Eclipse Foundation as an open Eclipse project.</p>
<p>Microsoft also will release the Silverlight Control Pack and publish on MSDN the technical specification for the Silverlight Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) vocabulary. The SCP, which will augment the powerful built-in control set in Silverlight, will be released under the Microsoft Permissive License, an Open Source Initiative-approved license, and includes controls such as DockPanel, ViewBox, TreeView, Accordion and AutoComplete. The Silverlight XAML vocabulary specification, released under the Open Specification Promise (OSP), will better enable third-party ISVs to create products that can read and write XAML for Silverlight.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of new Silverlight 2 features include the following:</strong></p>
<p>.NET Framework support with a rich base class library. This is a compatible subset of the full .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Powerful built-in controls. These include DataGrid, ListBox, Slider, ScrollViewer, Calendar controls and more.</p>
<p>Advanced skinning and templating support. This makes it easy to customize the look and feel of an application.</p>
<p>Deep zoom. This enables unparalleled interactivity and navigation of ultrahigh resolution imagery.</p>
<p>Comprehensive networking support. Out-of-the-box support allows calling REST, WS*/SOAP, POX, RSS and standard HTTP services, enabling users to create applications that easily integrate with existing back-end systems.</p>
<p>Expanded .NET Framework language support. Unlike other runtimes, Silverlight 2 supports a variety of programming languages, including Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, IronPython and IronRuby, making it easier for developers already familiar with one of these languages to repurpose their existing skill sets.</p>
<p>Advanced content protection. This now includes Silverlight DRM, powered by PlayReady, offering robust content protection for connected Silverlight experiences.</p>
<p>Improved server scalability and expanded advertiser support. This includes new streaming and progressive download capabilities, superior search engine optimization techniques, and next-generation in-stream advertising support.</p>
<p>Vibrant partner ecosystem. Visual Studio Industry Partners such as ComponentOne LLC, Infragistics Inc. and Telerik Inc. are providing products that further enhance developer capabilities when creating Silverlight applications using Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Cross-platform and cross-browser support. This includes support for Mac, Windows and Linux in Firefox, Safari and Windows Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>More information and details about Silverlight 2 are available by reading the Silverlight 2 fact sheet at http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/silverlight/default.mspx.</p>
<p>Silverlight 2 will be available for download on Tuesday, Oct. 14, at http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight. Customers already using a previous version of Silverlight will be automatically upgraded to Silverlight 2.</p>
<p>A technology preview of the Soyatec project is available today at http://www.eclipse4sl.org,/ with a complete version available in second half of 2009.</p>
