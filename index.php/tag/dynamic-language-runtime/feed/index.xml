<p>From the release notes:<br />
<br />The IronPython and Dynamic Language Runtime teams are proud to announce the release of IronPython 2.0 final.  IronPython 2.0 is the culmination of nearly two years worth of work resulting in a CPython 2.5 compatible release on .NET 2.0 SP1.  By far, the biggest change to 2.0 is that our 1.1 codebase was refactored to run on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime.  With this we automatically get improvements in many feature areas such as better .NET interop support and hosting Python from managed code.  There have been many other major improvements as well.  The most notable are:
<ul>
<li>An MSI installer for Windows platforms which includes parts of the CPython 2.5 standard library</li>
<li>IronPython assemblies targeting Silverlight and tools such as Chiron to improve the Silverlight dynamic development experience</li>
<li>The addition of more C-based standard modules such as cmath and _winreg</li>
<li>Significant improvements in importing compatibility and features</li>
<li>Distribution of IronPython under the Microsoft Public License which has been approved by OSI</li>
<li>Performance improvements.  On that note, a new Wiki page has been created for IronPython performance reports &#8211; see <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=IronPython%20Performance" class="externalLink">http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=IronPython%20Performance<span class="externalLinkIcon"></span></a></li>
<li>Over 500 bugs have been closed in 2.0.  453 of these were reported on CodePlex</li>
<li>Support for precompilation of Python source files into a single dll</li>
</ul>
