				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 19 and 20 November, the annual <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/2012/">SQL Server Days</a> will take place again. This 2 day event organized by the <a href="http://sqlug.be/">Belgian SQL Server User Group</a> is the event for all people working with MS SQL Server in Belgium (others are welcome too). From beginner to expert, from developer to DBA, from Excel specialist to BI designer.<br />
Why?<br />
Because they provide a different track for all the profiles even for the Oracle DBA&#8217;s.<br />
Because some international top speakers are coming like :
<ul>
<li> Bob Beauchemin (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/BOBB/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bobbeauch">Twitter</a>): Whenever you see someone from SQLskills on a speaker list you shouldn&#8217;t doubt and just go. I&#8217;ve seen Bob teaching in Barcelona twice and can assure you, listing to him is fun but be prepared for some deep learning</li>
<li> Dandy Weyn (<a href="http://www.ilikesql.com/">Blog </a>| https://twitter.com/ilikesql): The Belgian who presented the American MS SQL Server 2012 roadshow. Who wants to miss that?</li>
<li>Mladen Prajdic (<a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/default.aspx">Blog </a>| <a href="https://de.twitter.com/MladenPrajdic">Twitter</a>): When you&#8217;re able to write a SSMS plugin like the SSMS Tools Pack, you can tell a lot more about the tricks nobody heard of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because also Belgian top speakers will present some sessions :
<ul>
<li>Karel Coenye (<a href="https://twitter.com/Ryazame">twitter</a>) will be talking about the forgotten fill factor</li>
<li>Pieter Vanhove (<a href="http://blogs.sqlug.be/pieter/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/pieter_vanhove">twitter</a>)will help you set your backup settings right</li>
<li>Rising SSIS star Koen Verbeeck (<a href="http://twitter.com/Ko_Ver">twitter</a>) will celebrate the wedding between SSIS and CDC</li>
<li>O-Advisor Wesley Backelant (<a href="https://twitter.com/WesleyBackelant">twitter</a>)will finally tell you what this OData thing is you keep hearing about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you just want to meet over 400 peers from Belgium who work with MS SQL Server.<br />
So what are you waiting for?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response of my <a href="/index.php/ITStudents/LearnGetAnswers/choosing-the-right-training">previous post</a> about being sure you sign up for the correct training, I got the question where you could find training for more experienced DBA&#8217;s, for a reasonable price and not involving self-study. As I&#8217;m living in Belgium, I only can answer this question for my region. But I think you can use the same approach for other countries and regions.<br />
First of all it&#8217;s true, the basic implementing and maintaining courses are so popular that they are regularly scheduled. When you browse the <a href="http://learning.microsoft.com/Manager/Catalog.aspx?qry=SQL+Server+2012&amp;nav=trainingtype%3aClassroom+Training&amp;btn=1">Microsoft Training Catalog</a> you&#8217;ll find some other available trainings, it&#8217;s possible to call a training center and ask to schedule the training but keep in mind they need at least 2-3 students before they will start the training.<br />
Another possibility is walk-in trainings. It&#8217;s something new: you can book a walk-in training and make an appointment whenever you want during a couple of months. The idea is you get a PC with a recording of the training and a PC to do the exercises. So you can come and follow the training at your own pace and when you have time for it. It&#8217;s a pity that there are no SQL Server trainings available for the moment but we are working on it. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.oak3.be/oak3/walkinCalendar.jsp"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/axel8s/FindTrain1.jpg?mtime=1337766271" width="152" height="108" /></a></div>
<p>Second place to check is your local <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/nl/newsletters/">Microsoft website</a>. Sign-up for the newsletters and check the events they are announcing. The events they organize are not always very technical but can give you a head start when it comes to new products and releases. Check <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nicktrog/archive/2012/04/06/register-for-a-free-sql-server-2012-training.aspx">this blog</a> where they announce some sessions about some new features in SQL Server 2012.</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032505931&amp;IO=EyEgX%2fLgmnoaz0j6vViSeA%3d%3d"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/axel8s/FindTrain2.png?mtime=1337766284" width="135" height="137" /></a></div>
<p>They also organize the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/techdays/2012/Home.aspx">TechDays</a> every year where they have a lot of sessions about different Microsoft Technologies. Make sure you check the agenda and see if there are sessions you&#8217;re interested in. On the other hand it&#8217;s also a place where you can meet the local MEET members and ask your questions. More in-depth sessions but also for more money, you have the yearly TechEd week.</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="http://europe.msteched.com/"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/axel8s/FindTrain3.jpg?mtime=1337766307" width="180" height="390" /></a></div>
<p>Also don&#8217;t forget to sign up for the local SQL Server User group (<a href="http://sqlug.be/">site</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sqlug">twitter</a>). They organize sessions during the year about different SQL Server subjects. Also once a year they have their own <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/">SQL Server Days</a>, 2 days with 3 SQL Server tracks full of sessions for almost no money. Together with other User groups they also organize every year a <a href="http://www.communityday.be/">Community Day</a>. Again just check if you find the sessions interesting or just go and meet the experts at the different user group booths.</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.communityday.be/cd/tabid/36/Default.aspx"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/axel8s/FindTrain4.png?mtime=1337766326" width="600" height="90" /></a></div>
<p>If you have more budget and are allowed to go abroad, keep an eye on <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/">Pass</a> or <a href="http://sqlbits.com/">SQLBits</a> they also organize events in Europe with top international speakers.<br />
And last but not least. Instead of the money for a 5-day training and your wage, you can hire a consultant for at least 2 days who can come over, answer all your questions, audit your environment and coach you on how and WHY you should make some changes to your environment.<br />
I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of other options to learn more about SQL Server. But this will get you started.</p>
