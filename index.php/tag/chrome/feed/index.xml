				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to take a look at my <a href="/index.php/WebDev/WebDesignGraphicsStyling/has-firefox-lost-its-mojo-are-firefox-us">Has FireFox lost its Mojo, are Firefox user jumping ship to Chrome?</a> post to compare the browser stats. In that post I wrote the following </p>
<blockquote><p>So what will happen to Firefox will they ever pass 25% or is this a downward spiral and within a year Chrome will have that 25% and Firefox will be at 15% or so? With all the new stuff like the Google&#8217;s App Store that Google is adding to Chrome its usage will have to grow fast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well Firefox never reached 25%, as a matter of fact Firefox  is at less than 20% market share today. Here is what the stats look like for the last 12 months according to <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1">NetMarket Share</a></p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/BrowserStats.PNG?mtime=1328978705"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/BrowserStats.PNG?mtime=1328978705" width="805" height="235" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see Chrome has almost surpassed Firefox, I think that in 2 or 3 months Google will have surpassed Firefox. A lot of people still use Firefox because of the fact that some extensions don&#8217;t exist on Chrome. NoScript is a big one, Chrome has actually somethign similar, it is called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiigbmnaadbkfbmpbfijlflahbdbdgdf">ScriptNo</a>. FireBug is another reason that people stick with FireFox for now. Even Germany&#8217;s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/5/2771834/german-agency-google-chrome-safety">recommending Chrome</a> now, they did not pick FireFox.</p>
<p>A lot of people are ranting about the fact that Firefox has become bloated, yes compared to Internet Explorer it might look lean but compared to Chrome it certainly does not. We have to wait and see what happens, I will revisit this again early next year. </p>
<p>I also wonder if the release of Windows 8 will do anything to make Internet Explorer gain some market share again?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is about stats from hits to this website. I always find this interesting because you can get a feel of what is moving and shaking in the tech industry. Of course the stats on this site are heavily skewed towards technology and although this site is small compared to something like reddit or del.icio.us we still get millions of hits a year so it is not a sample of 10 hits  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Smart phones</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/SmartPhones.png" alt="" title="" width="559" height="285" /><br />
As you can see from that chart, in January iPhone was at 70% and it ended up in December at 34%, Android went from 13% to 40%, Android activations are almost double now compared to Apple&#8217;s in the last quarter. My predictions is that Android will have at least 55% share by the end of next year. It is not all doom and gloom for Apple however, the iPad managed to rise to almost 19% since April. Below are the numbers that were used to generate the chart.</p>

<h2>Browsers</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/Browsers.png" alt="" title="" width="598" height="279" /><br />
The year 2010 was a very good year for Chrome, Chrome has more than doubled its share, FireFox lost about 8% and IE lost about 5%. Now that Chrome has a lot of the Extensions that FireFox has I think even more people will switch to Chrome, I have been using Chrome since the first beta version and have never gone back to fireFox or IE. My predictions is that Chrome will capture a third of the market by the end of next year.</p>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/IE.png" alt="" title="" width="592" height="297" /><br />
Internet Explorer 6 is slowly going to below 5% share, IE8 is the most used browser with almost 70% share. I tried IE 9 a couple of times, I like the speed and the other improvements it has but it won&#8217;t be enough to make me switch from Chrome</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Chrome for over a year now and have been very happy with it. Yesterday version 5 was released, you can get it here: http://www.google.com/chrome</p>
<p>I decided to look at some stats for this site and compared April of this year to April of last year. The image below has this information.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//BrowserPercentage.PNG" alt="" title="" width="592" height="756" /></p>
<p>As you can see FireFox lost about 10% while Chrome gained 9% and Safari gained almost 1%. So what is going on, are the early adapters switching to Chrome from FireFox? Take a look at the <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1">NetMarket stats</a></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//stats.PNG" alt="" title="" width="750" height="242" /></p>
<p>FireFox had 24.72% of all bowser traffic in November, in April it had 24.59%, FireFox didn&#8217;t gain anything in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>So what is going on? When Internet Explorer 6 was the dominant browser it was very easy for FireFox to grab market share. Internet Explorer 6 was a mess, Internet Explorer 8 is better but still not as good as either FireFox or Chrome in my opinion.</p>
<p>So what will happen to FireFox will they ever pass 25% or is this a downward spiral and within a year Chrome will have that 25% and FireFox will be at 15% or so? With all the new stuff like the Google&#8217;s App Store that Google is adding to Chrome its usage will have to grow fast.</p>
<p>What browser do you use and did you try Chrome and if so did you like it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to do a little test on one of my machines with the three browsers I use most. In each browser I opened up <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?tab=ym">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/?cnn=yes">CNNMoney</a>.<br />
I did this on Friday and did not look at the memory usage until Monday. After a little less than 3 days, we get the following numbers</p>
<p><strong>Chromium 1.0.154.48</strong><br />
180,157k</p>
<p><strong>IE 8.00.6001.18372</strong><br />
362,223k</p>
<p><strong>Firefox 3.0.4</strong><br />
100,148k</p>
<p>Looking at these numbers makes you think that Google wrote Gmail and Google Reader in such a way that it on purpose made Internet Explorer leak memory like a bucket without a bottom.</p>
<pre>If IE 
   then leak memory 
else 
   behave normally</pre>
<p>I don&#8217;t know but this is just crazy, don&#8217;t come to me either saying that IE8 is beta, so what, this is insane! IE8 uses 362MB while FireFox 3 only uses 100MB. Chrome compared to Firefox uses almost double the memory. Chrome + FireFox combine still use 80MB less than Internet Explorer 8</p>
<p>Below is a screen shot of what memory usage looks like</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/3322981762/" title="FireFox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 8 Memory Usage"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3594/3322981762_be28114019_o.jpg" width="654" height="192" alt="Browsers" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to get the new Chrome features as soon as possible then you are in luck; Google has launched the Google Chrome Dev Channel. The Google Chrome Dev Channel will give you early access to features and fixes.</p>
<p>The Dev channel is useful for:<br />
<strong>Web developers</strong> who want to test their sites or scripts with pre-release versions of Google Chrome<br />
<strong>Testers</strong> who need to make sure they&#8217;re working with the latest bug fixes<br />
<strong>Anyone who wants to help make Google Chrome better</strong> &#8212; your feedback helps us turn good new features into great features, and using the Dev channel is a simple way for anyone to help.</p>
<p>Dev channel releases are less stable than Beta channel releases. Expect the occasional &#8220;sad tab&#8221; or even browser crashes (if you turn on &#8216;Help make Google Chrome better..&#8217; in Options, we&#8217;ll get the crash reports so we can fix the bugs).</p>
<p>Automatic updates of new Dev channel releases are published every 1-2 weeks</p>
<p>Get all the details and what you need to download here: http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel</p>
<p>The first version has been posted. There are a bunch of fixes<br />
<strong>Plugins</strong><br />

r1859 Fix YouTube (and other Flash videos) halting if the time-advance slider is used.<br />
r1958 Fixes a problem with Shockwave/Flash games not loading (issue 643)</p>
<p><strong>Crashes</strong><br />
