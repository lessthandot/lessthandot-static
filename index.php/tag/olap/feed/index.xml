				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been working with <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/sybase-iq-is-a-columnar-database-why-sho">Sybase IQ</a> then you might be familiar with what a columnstore database is.</p>
<p>SQL Server has added a new type of index which is column based instead of row based, this is the columnstore index. I will create another post this week that will show you how to create such an index, right now I will only show you the difference between a query against a regular index and against a columnstore index, this way you can get an idea of the performance difference.</p>
<p>Both of these tables have identical data and have 1 million rows.</p>
<pre>SELECT COUNT(*),SomeValue FROM TestRowStore 
group by SomeValue

SELECT COUNT(*),SomeValue FROM TestColumnStore 
group by SomeValue</pre>
<p>Here is the execution plan for this query, click on the image for a larger size</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/5935723862/sizes/l/in/photostream/" title="ColumnStore Index by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6021/5935723862_8f99cca495_b.jpg" width="1024" height="261" alt="ColumnStore Index Execution Plan" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see the columnstore index performs better.</p>
<p>Here are the reads</p>
<p><em>Table &#8216;TestRowStore&#8217;. Scan count 3, <strong>logical reads 9636</strong>, physical reads 0, read-ahead reads 0<br />
Table &#8216;TestColumnStore&#8217;. Scan count 2, <strong>logical reads 8</strong>, physical reads 0, read-ahead reads 0</em></p>
<p>The difference in reads is dramatic</p>
<p>And here are the execution times</p>
<p><em> SQL Server Execution Times:<br />
   CPU time = 328 ms,  elapsed time = <strong>185 ms</strong>.</p>
<p> SQL Server Execution Times:<br />
   CPU time = 0 ms,  elapsed time = <strong>3 ms</strong>.</em><br />
<br />
This is all cool right? Unfortunately, there are things you cannot do (yet) when using a columnstore index.<br />
A table with a columnstore index is read only, and cannot be updated(another post will talk about using partitions to makes this less painful)<br />
Right now, a columnstore index supports only common business data types like int, real, string, money, datetime, the decimal data type has to be less than 18 digits.<br />
You cannot truncate a table with a columnstore index</p>
<p>I decided to look in the sysmessages table for any messages that had columnstore in the description</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> &nbsp;description &nbsp;<span class="kw1">from</span> sys.<span class="me1">sysmessages</span>
<span class="kw1">where</span> msglangid <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="nu0">1033</span>
and description like<span class="st0">'%columnstore%'</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select  description  from sys.sysmessages
where msglangid = 1033
and description like'%columnstore%'</pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the whole list of errors that SQL Server might throw when you try to do things that are not supported. Keep in mind that sysmessages only returns the first 255 characters so some of the messages are cut</p>
<p><em>

</ul>
<p></em></p>
<p>So with all these limitations why would you want to use this kind of index? This index is not for your typical OLTP workload, it is for people that want OLAP response time without having to create OLAP cubes, summary tables and indexed views. </p>
<p>I can already see a couple of places that I will be using columnstore indexes</p>

<p>Steve Jones (<a href="http://twitter.com/way0utwest">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/steve_jones/default.aspx">Blog</a>), The Voice of the DBA, is hosting the T-SQL Tuesday blogging fest over on <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/steve_jones/archive/2010/12/07/t_2D00_sql-tuesday-_2300_13-_2D00_-what-the-business-says-is-not-what-the-business-wants.aspx">SQLServerCentral.com</a> this month.  The topic is one that has been a battle between DBAs, Developers and even managers since the creation of computing in the business itself.  It causes heated arguments, career changes, trips to your psychiatrist and worst of all, more work and over-thinking that is ever needed for some projects.  <i>What the Business Says Is Not What the Business Wants</i>.</p>
<p><strong>The common theme</strong></p>
<p>Business is growing, data is growing and your reporting solutions are suffering.  The Business comes to your hard working, Grade A Senior DBA and asks, &#8220;We need cubes and cool software to fix this slow and lame reporting issue we have&#8221;.</p>
<p>The next steps in your reply to this question are the most critical to your OLTP database servers and countless sleepless nights trying to maintain endless database server problems.</p>
<p><strong>The Business</strong></p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/olap_2.gif" alt="" title="" width="67" height="91" align="right" /></div>
<p>Let’s get something out of the way: Business doesn’t care what you need to do, they want it now and they want exactly what they want.  I’m not against third party reporting solutions, cube generators and so on.  In fact, some of them are brilliant, intuitive and functional tools that are extremely efficient.  I’ve been involved in  decisions to purchase some of them and implement them.  They were all good experiences and successful for the most part.</p>
<p><strong>Not what they want</strong></p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/olap_3.gif" alt="" title="" width="160" height="126" align="left" /></div>
<p>What the business is venturing into here is OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).  OLAP sits on a warehouse (or multiple warehouses).  A warehouse in general is a data source in which one or more OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) data sources have been taken and collected into the centralized data source.  In most cases these OLTP data sources are denormalized for enhanced performance.  Denormalization is the method in which tables that have been normalized to some degree are taken and combined into one larger table.  This is all done while still retaining some integrity in keeping the data free of corruption (or making it dirty).  In all, denormalizing creates a great deal of redundancy.  Redundancy in reporting is normal though.  OLAP database servers are meant to handle this type of design with different configurations and hardware to ensure processing is as fast as possible given the designs.</p>
<p>Recall the business request of throwing the vendor product into the existing database landscape in order to resolve the reporting issues.  The key that is missing is the need for a warehouse to sit behind that reporting solution.  Without this critical planning and implementation stage, reporting tools will not become a solution but only worsen the already troubled situation.  Now instead of reports that were created and reading from the OLTP sources, there will be cubes processing on-demand, users pulling directly from the OLTP sources with much higher level calculations and resource consumption will start to occur at much greater levels.  </p>
<p><strong>Give them what they want</strong></p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/olap_4.gif" alt="" title="" width="109" height="109" align="left" /></div>
<p>Even if you are one voice in a large data team, it is your job to speak up, knowing the problems that will endure from not properly putting the data source in place that the reporting solutions should be utilizing.  Yes, implementing a warehouse will take months and a large amount of planning and work.  The fact remains, though, that without the proper planning and implementation, your nights will be longer.  As hard as it is to sometimes to remember, business looks to you as a database professional to make the right choices to better the business.  These types of implementations are a large part of that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft just announced that they have finalized the DATAllegro acquisition: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/sep08/09-16DAPR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases">Microsoft Closes Acquisition of DATAllegro</a></p>
<p>Some interesting thing in this press release:<br />
<blockquote>Microsoft will offer a new solution based on DATAllegro’s technology that extends Microsoft SQL Server to scale into hundreds of terabytes of data. The company will begin giving customers and partners early access to the combined solution through community technology previews (CTPs) within the next 12 months, with full product availability scheduled for the first half of calendar year 2010.<br />
“Microsoft recently launched SQL Server 2008, which is already attracting a great deal of attention thanks to all of the new functionality for mission-critical data management and business intelligence — in fact, it’s been downloaded more than 500,000 times,” said Ted Kummert, corporate vice president of the Data and Storage Platform Division at Microsoft. “These capabilities, combined with DATAllegro’s ability to scale to hundreds of terabytes, present an extremely powerful solution set for customers and partners, and we are committed to getting it in their hands as soon as possible.”<br />
“SQL Server has already brought so much value to our organization, whether it’s giving us more insight into our data, reducing demands on our hardware or simply speeding up the performance of our applications,” said Ron Van Zanten, directing officer of Business Intelligence, Premier Bankcard Inc. “Perhaps more important, it’s delivered all of these benefits without requiring changes to our existing infrastructure. DATAllegro’s technology is a natural complement to SQL Server, so we are excited about the possibilities this acquisition will bring.”</p>
<p>Already a recognized leader in data warehousing and business intelligence (BI), SQL Server 2008 is the only solution in the industry that includes comprehensive, tightly integrated functionality for data management and advanced BI out of the box. Microsoft is positioned in the Leaders quadrant in Gartner Inc.’s Magic Quadrant for the Business Intelligence Platforms1 and the Magic Quadrant for Data Warehouse Database Management Systems2 and in the Visionaries quadrant in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for CPM Suites, 2007.3 Together, we believe that these placements validate the importance of Microsoft’s overall BI vision — to provide all individuals, teams and entire organizations with BI solutions that drive bottom-line performance and operational excellence. By extending SQL Server with DATAllegro’s technology, Microsoft will now be able to offer customers and partners one of the highest scales of data warehousing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some interesting things about DATAllegro itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>DATAllegro v3 performs table scans between 0.5TB/minute and 10.5TB/minute. DATAllegro v3 offers new capabilities to handle complex workloads that are a mixture of near real-time loads, long analytical queries and short quick-hit queries. Improved workload management gives queries with low workloads higher priority, reducing the overall workload on the server. DATAllegro also provides a comprehensive architecture with a high-speed loader performing loads at rate of over 1TB/hour. The loading server or landing zone within the high-speed appliance network is used to provide a loading services with a minimal impact to queries being run.</p></blockquote>
