		<description><![CDATA[Learn how to create mailing labels using existing information in your database and SQL Server Reporting Services!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 R2 </em> </p>
<p>Creating mailing labels is a common business need. From sending marketing postcards to prospects, to the annual Christmas cards for customers, labels are frequently used. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSEnvelopes.JPG?mtime=1298822743"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSEnvelopes.JPG?mtime=1298822743" width="424" height="283" /></a></div>
<p>Are you currently running a report to get your customers mailing information, then using Mail Merge in Microsoft Word to create the labels? Perhaps you are simply exporting the data out of the database. If so, there is an easier way! </p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step </strong></p>
<p>The basic steps are to: create a report with multiple columns, add a list, add a textbox, write an expression, and let Reporting Services do the hard work! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m using Avery 5160 labels as an example. Depending on the labels you have, you may need adjust your columns, width, height and padding. </p>
<p>1. Create a new, blank report. I&#8217;m using the AdventureWorks database. My query is:</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="sql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">SELECT</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FirstName<span class="sy0">,</span> LastName<span class="sy0">,</span> AddressLine1<span class="sy0">,</span> AddressLine2<span class="sy0">,</span> City<span class="sy0">,</span> StateProvinceName<span class="sy0">,</span> PostalCode
<span class="kw1">FROM</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sales<span class="sy0">.</span>vIndividualCustomer</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SELECT        FirstName, LastName, AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City, StateProvinceName, PostalCode
FROM            Sales.vIndividualCustomer</pre></div></div>

<p>2. Go to the Report properties.<br />
A. Expand Columns, and add the appropriate number of columns. In this example, this will be three.<br />
B. You&#8217;ll need to add in the spacing between the labels, too, so they line up correctly when printed. This may be trial and error. In this example, it is .03125 inches.<br />
C. Set your Margins. In this example, they are Left 0, Right 0, Top 0.1875, and Bottom 0. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels1.JPG?mtime=1298823148"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels1.JPG?mtime=1298823148" width="218" height="508" /></a></div>
<p>3. Drag a List onto the report. Adjust the Size to be the Width and Height of your labels, plus a little extra for the strips that go between them. Avery 5160 have a width of 2.8125 and a Height of 1.0625. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels2.JPG?mtime=1298823148"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels2.JPG?mtime=1298823148" width="219" height="346" /></a></div>
<p>4. Drag a Textbox onto the List.<br />
A. Set the Width and Height properties of the textbox. Again, a width of 2.8125 and a height of 1.0625.<br />
B. You&#8217;ll also need to adjust the Padding. Remember, this box is slightly larger than the actual labels because of the margins and area between the labels. I set Padding to Left &#8211; 15pt, Right &#8211; 15 pt, Top &#8211; 0 pt, Bottom &#8211; 0 pt. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels4.JPG?mtime=1298823149"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels4.JPG?mtime=1298823149" width="218" height="359" /></a></div>
<p>5. Set the properties of the Body. Again, a width of 2.8125 and a height of 1.0625 was used. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels5.JPG?mtime=1298823149"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels5.JPG?mtime=1298823149" width="217" height="232" /></a></div>
<p>6. Go to your textbox and build an expression for your labels. My expression is: </p>
<p><code class="codespan">=Fields!FirstName.Value &amp;amp; " " &amp;amp; Fields!LastName.Value &amp;amp; vbcrlf<br />
&amp;amp; Fields!AddressLine1.Value &amp;amp; " " &amp;amp; IIF(NOT(Fields!AddressLine2.Value) = "Nothing", vbcrlf &amp;amp; Fields!AddressLine2.Value, vbcrlf)<br />
&amp;amp; Fields!City.Value &amp;amp; ", " &amp;amp; Fields!StateProvinceName.Value &amp;amp; " " &amp;amp; Fields!PostalCode.Value</code></p>
<p>7. At this point, Design looks like this: </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels6.JPG?mtime=1298823150"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels6.JPG?mtime=1298823150" width="865" height="179" /></a></div>
<p>8. Now, go to Preview. You will only see one column of textboxes. This is by design. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels7.JPG?mtime=1298823150"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels7.JPG?mtime=1298823150" width="477" height="451" /></a></div>
<p>9. Click the Print Layout button and you will see how the labels will print. There are three columns, with the labels nicely laid out! These can now be printed, or exported and printed. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels8.JPG?mtime=1298823152"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/SSRSLabels8.JPG?mtime=1298823152" width="891" height="596" /></a></div>
<p><strong>Put It In The Mail! </strong></p>
<p>This process is straightforward and can save you time, especially if you are creating labels frequently. Your report can easily be customized with parameters, also, to make it more flexible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you need an SSRS 2005 report that displays totals for the previous 3 months going horizontally across ?  Well, I did, and my first approach involved using derived tables, each with a separate date range, to get each month’s total to appear in its own column.  While I achieved my goal, performance was lousy because the query needed to execute 3 times (once for each date range).</p>
<p>I shaved 2 minutes off the query execution time with a second approach.  This alternate approach involves using a single query for the entire, 3-month date range, along with a GROUP BY clause including year and month.  For the SSRS piece, I use a matrix format to get the months to display horizontally across.  Since I have additional columns to display besides the total, I have to do some extra maneuvering, but more on that, later.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the T-SQL code:</p>

<p>With the stored procedure written, I’ll go to SSRS 2005 and add a Matrix Report Item.  I then drag the year field to the matrix cell that displays columns, the TerritoryID field (leftmost column on desired report) to the matrix cell that displays rows and the qty field to the matrix data cell (where the columns and rows intersect).</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/ssrs_matrix_1.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>
<p>However, this is not a simple matrix scenario as I have several additional columns I need to display, besides the totals by month.  In order to accomplish this, I’ll add row groups for each additional column.</p>
<p>But first, I’ll start with the column groups.  I right-click above the year column group and choose ‘Add Column Group’ to add the month…</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Add_Column_Group.gif" alt="" title="" width="147" height="98" /></div>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix3.gif" alt="" title="" width="488" height="467" /></div>
<p>…and sort on the month field:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix4.gif" alt="" title="" width="488" height="467" /></div>
<p>That takes care of my column groups.</p>
<p>I proceed in the same fashion for my row groups.  I right-click on the first row group and choose ‘Add Row Group’:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Add_Row_Group.gif" alt="" title="" width="147" height="98" /></div>
<p>I group (and sort) on the next field I want to appear on the report, the ProductNumber:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix6.gif" alt="" title="" width="488" height="467" /></div>
<p>I repeat this until I have all the columns I need.  </p>
<p>As an additional step, for each column and row group I want to sort on, I make sure I’m sorting on the same field I’m grouping on.  To check this, I right-click on the group and choose ‘Edit Group’:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix7.gif" alt="" title="" width="130" height="288" /></div>
<p>Now, the headings for the row group columns are missing because the Matrix Report Item has only an empty box in the upper, lefthand corner by default.  To avoid ambiguity in the report, I add a Rectangle Report Item (to the upper, lefthand corner) then textboxes, one for each column needed:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix8.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>
<p>I then type in the row group column headings:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix9.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>
<p>I also apply some formatting to improve the appearance of the report, including editing the expression for month so that the month name appears:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix10.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="390" /></div>
<p>And voilà !  Below you see the finished report that is speedy and even has column headings for the extra row group columns !</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix11.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>

I&#8217;ve been approached on the web, in the SQL Community and in person several times with the question: &#8220;My Reporting Services instance loads Report Manager extremely slow.  Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few common primary causes of this.  One is the instance being located on a DMZ and behind policies that cause the slow load times.  I’m not a network guru and haven’t played in that field for 7-8 years so I can&#8217;t give you a lot of ideas to fix it.  I can say, check it if you are on that landscape and getting the slow load times.</p>
<p>The other cause comes down to locally installed firewalls and virus scan programs on the server (or machine you have SSRS installed on) blocking some or all access for Reporting Services, certain ports and ASP.NET.  Firewalls are the devil from the inside out.  I hate to say it, being the security crazed DBA I am but they do cause some headaches when working with features like Reporting Services that look to Internet Explorer for assistance in loading. </p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to purchase a new laptop recently and installed my usual Developer Edition landscape.  This included Reporting Services 2008.  This gave me a chance to write this and recreate the exact situation many of you may fall into.
</p>
<h2><i>So let’s fix it together</i></h2>
<p>
On my new Dell XPS I have McAfee Security installed.  It came with the laptop and isn’t all that bad.  Does the job!  But, when I open my Report Manager session, it takes around 5 minutes to load.  Wow! I’m not a patient DBA.  I like measuring things in nanoseconds.  It is the foundation of why I purchase hardware at work that is way overboard and scalable.  So my first inclination is to turn to the Windows Firewall.  I know a lot of people may disagree with me, but I turn it off.  It is good and I understand the concept behind it, but in our world, it can cause more problems than it&#8217;s worth.  I’m behind my Cisco firewall and the McAfee firewall.  I think I’m ok for now until a script kiddy reads this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I opened the McAfee Security Center and navigated to the location I assume will be causing the problem &#8212; the firewall configuration.  In this configuration I see that the Firewall protection is enabled and the option for configuring it is there.  Upon opening this configuration I am presented with a listing of programs/files that have particular &#8220;access&#8221; settings.  </p>
<p>In this listing I quickly notice that my SQL Server Analysis Service instance is blocked.  Fixed that!
</p>
<p><div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/manager_slow.gif" alt="" title="" width="557" height="294" /></div>
<p>After searching the listing farther down, I find the settings for Reporting Services (and Report Builder).  The access is set to Outbound-Only Access.  This should be Full Access for the instance to function completely.  It is important to note that this would not stop functionality of Reporting Services out of the box typically.  You can run and develop SSRS on an island successfully.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/manager_slow2.gif" alt="" title="" width="557" height="360" /></div>
<p>You can see there is an option to, “Allow Access” in the Action window.  I selected this and rebooted the laptop to clear all cache and load of the Report Manager.  I did this because the initial load is commonly the only slow period when ASP.NET starts.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/manager_slow3.gif" alt="" title="" width="540" height="257" /></div>
<p>The largest problem is the firewall not allowing the action to be performed entirely.  </p>
<p>I also found that port 1433 was being heavily scanned along with port 80.  Next I found the &#8220;real-time&#8221; scanning settings and had to set the required files and services to Trusted.  I basically found a few odds and ends just short of completely turning it off.  I’m not recommending that of course.  I’m recommending finding the setting your exact situation requires.  All virus and firewalls are different and it isn’t feasible to cover them all here.  </p>
<p>Again, another reboot is required to determine if the settings fixed my problem
</p>
<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>
<p>
My firewall configurations fixed the local Report Manager initial loading time problem and allowed ASP.NET and SSRS to do what it needed to without slowing the process.  At the same time I found my entire SSAS instance was completely blocked.  So if you find yourself with Report Manager loading in about 5 minutes (give or take an hour), try disabling the local firewall and see if it resolves the problem down to normal initial load times.  Then enable it and dig into the configuration settings to allow Reporting Service and ASP.NET to function correctly.  Normal load times are around 30-45 seconds after a complete restart from this lab.  In other resource intense servers that will be quicker.  If it goes much over that, I would start looking into the problem.  </p>
<p>Last, I highly recommend always digging into BOL before going crazy and breaking your servers.  There is a page dedicated to short descriptions on possible performance issues.  Primarily surrounding, slow performance.<br />
