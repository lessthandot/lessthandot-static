				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I am going through the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137081073/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0137081073&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sql08-20">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a> by Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob)</p>
<p>In chapter 1, section <em>know your field</em>, a list of artifacts is mentioned that you should know as a programmer. If you don&#8217;t know these things then apparently you suck, so let&#8217;s see how many of these do you know?</p>
<ul>
<li>Parnas Tables</li>
<li>Nassi-Schneiderman Charts</li>
<li>UML</li>
<li>Data Flow Diagram</li>
<li>Structure Charts</li>
<li>Petri Nets</li>
<li>State Transition Diagrams and Tables</li>
<li>Flow Charts</li>
<li>Decision Tables</li>
<li>Tramp Data</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your count? Leave a comment with your count, it will be interesting to see how many people actually know all these things.</p>
<p>I knew only six of these things by name. However when I looked them up I realized that I have used or seen almost all of them, even though I did not know what the correct name was for them</p>
<p>Tramp Data was an interesting one, I did not know that term. Tramp Data is data which is passed from one function to another, and not used by the first function.</p>
<p>What do you think, should all programmers know all of these artifacts?</p>
