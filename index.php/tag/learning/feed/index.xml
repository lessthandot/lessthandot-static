				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget about those crazy Mayans and their stupid calendar, 2012 is here to stay! Is your new year&#8217;s resolution to learn how to code? I have some good news for you, if you don&#8217;t know how to code but would like to learn, there is help on the way. There is a new site (at least new for me) that will help you accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Here is what they say on their page.</p>
<blockquote><p>Code Year</p>
<p>10,620 people have decided to learn to code in 2012.<br />
Why not you?</p>
<p>Make your New Year&#8217;s resolution learning to code.<br />
Sign up on Code Year to get a new interactive programming lesson sent to you each week and you&#8217;ll be building apps<br />
and web sites before you know it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is pretty cool, you can also keep tabs on your friends&#8217; progress and make sure you&#8217;re learning more and faster. This is all great stuff.</p>
<p>Check it out here: http://codeyear.com/</p>
<p>Happy coding, leave me a comment if you signed up because of this post.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<hr />
Even New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined the site</p>
<blockquote><p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has resolved to take an online computer coding course.</p>
<p>The mayor is joining more than 180,000 people currently taking part in Code Year, a campaign to encourage more people to programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;My New Year&#8217;s resolution is to learn to code with Codeacademy in 2012!&#8221; he wrote on Twitter.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone posted an <a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=100&amp;t=15486">Ada Lovelace day message in our forum</a>. Here is what it said</p>
<blockquote><p>This Ada Lovelace Day on October 7, share your story about a woman — whether an engineer, a scientist, a technologist or mathematician — who has inspired you to become who you are today. Write a blog post, record a podcast, film a video, draw a comic, or pick any other way to talk about the women who have been guiding lights in your life. Give your heroine the credit she deserves!</p></blockquote>

After thinking a little, I realized that I am not doing what I am doing because of any man or woman, but I am better at what I do thanks to a woman&#8230;.</p>
<p>This person is of course <strong>Kalen Delaney</strong>. It started all with the Inside SQL Server books for me..I still have the hardcover 2000 edition at home and will keep it for sentimental reasons (same is true for Ken Henderson&#8217;s guru books)</p>
<p>Kalen makes a lot of information available through her <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/kalen_delaney/">blog</a>, her training, the contributions to SQL Server magazine and of course her books. The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735626243/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0735626243">Microsoft® SQL Server 2008 Internals</a> that she co-authored is a must have if you want to get to the next level of SQL Server knowledge</p>
<p>After reading the Inside SQL book certain things about SQL Server made a lot more sense to me, for example the fact that you couldn&#8217;t fit more than 8060 bytes in a row, well this is because the pages were 8K. There were many more examples like that.</p>
<p>Kalen is also involved with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290475/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1617290475">SQL Server MVP Deep Dives Vol. 2</a> book, just like with the previous version all author royalties will be donated to charity.</p>
<p>Thank you Kalen for providing all that wonderful information in a variety of formats&#8230;the SQL community is thankful!!</p>
<p>So my readers, which women have influenced you over the years? Leave me a comment or blog about it and drop me a link in the comments&#8230;.</p>
