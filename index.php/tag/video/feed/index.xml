				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kaxaml is a lightweight XAML editor that gives you a &#8220;split view&#8221; so you can see both your XAML and your rendered content (kind of like XamlPad but without the gigabyte of SDK).</p>
<p>First watch the video on channel 9 to see what it looks like. Here is what is covered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Robby Ingebretsen came by to explain what Kaxaml is and how it can be useful to you when developing XAML-based applications.  Not only does he introduce the tool, but he also touches on some of the lesser known features and add-ins that may be missed on an initial glance.</p>
<p>Robby also discusses the fact that he will be presenting two workshops at MIX09.  The first is Design Fundamentals for Developers and the second, with Jaime Rodriguez, Hiking Mt Avalon.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can watch the show here: http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/Kaxaml/</p>
<p>The video runs for 18 minutes and 11 seconds</p>
<p>You can download Kaxaml here: http://www.kaxaml.com/</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flash Player 10 has been released, here are the new or enhanced features</p>
<p><strong>3D effects <em>New</em></strong><br />
Create more intuitive, engaging interfaces using built-in support for 3D effects. Get started quickly without being a 3D master by designing in 2D and easily transforming and animating in 3D. Fast, extremely lightweight, and simple-to-use APIs, along with 3D tools in Adobe® Flash® CS4 Professional software, make motion that was previously accessible only to expert users via ActionScript® language or custom third-party libraries available to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Custom filters and effects <em>New</em></strong><br />
Create high-performance, real-time effects for cinematic experiences that quickly engage users. With new Adobe Pixel Bender™, the same technology behind many filters and effects in Adobe After Effects® software, these dynamic and interactive effects can be used both in production with After Effects CS4 and live with Flash Player 10. The Pixel Bender just-in- time (JIT) compiler can also be used to process other types of data, such as sound or mathematical functions, asynchronously in a separate thread.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced text support <em>New</em></strong><br />
Take advantage of a new, flexible text layout engine that brings print-quality publishing to the web, building on more than 25 years of Adobe expertise in typography. Gain more control over text layout using an extensible library of ActionScript 3.0 text components to flow text and sophisticated typographic elements such as ligatures across multiple columns, around inline images, bidirectionally, vertically, or chained together. Create multilingual rich Internet applications (RIAs) using device fonts that can now be anti-aliased, rotated, and styled, or build your own unique text components.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic sound generation <em>New</em></strong><br />
Use enhanced sound APIs to dynamically generate audio and create new types of audio applications such as music mixers and sequencers, real-time audio for games, and even audio visualizers. Work with loaded MP3 audio at a lower level by extracting audio data and supplying it to the sound buffer. Process, filter, and mix audio in real time through the Pixel Bender JIT compiler to extend creative freedom beyond the visual experience.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing API <em>Enhanced</em></strong><br />
Perform runtime drawing more easily with restyleable properties, 3D APIs, and a new way of drawing sophisticated shapes without having to code them line by line. Developers can tweak parts of curves, change styling, replace parts, and use custom filters and effects, delivering improved throughput, creative control, and greater productivity. Enhancements to the Drawing API add the z dimension, real perspective, textured meshes in 3D space, a retained graphics model, read/write rendering, and triangle drawing with UV coordinates, while adding memory and improving performance.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware acceleration <em>Enhanced</em></strong><br />
Use the hardware processing power of the graphics card to paint SWF files into the browser and accelerate compositing calculations of bitmaps, filters, blend modes, and video overlays faster than would be performed in software.</p>
<p><strong>Vector data type <em>New</em></strong><br />
Use the new typed array class for better performance, efficiency, and error checking of data.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Streaming <em>New</em></strong><br />
Show exceptional video with streams that automatically adjust to changing network conditions. Leverage new quality-of-service metrics to provide a better streaming experience.</p>
<p><strong>Speex audio codec <em>New</em></strong><br />
Take advantage of the new, high-fidelity and open source Speex voice codec, which offers a low-latency alternative for voice encoding. Flash Player also supports ADPCM, HE-AAC, MP3, and Nellymoser audio.</p>
<p><strong>File upload and download APIs <em>Enhanced</em></strong><br />
Bring users into the experience by letting them load and save files from your web application. New file reference runtime access allows local processing of data without roundtripping to the server.</p>
<p>The latest version of the Adobe Flash Player is  10.0.12.36<br />
