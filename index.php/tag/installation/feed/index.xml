		<description><![CDATA[Which minimal components do you need to install to run SSIS packages on a server? Let's find out!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Or in other words, what do I need to install during SQL Server setup in order to end up with a fully operational SSIS server with a minimal surface area configuration? I came up with this blog post after I participated in the following thread at the MSDN forum: <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqlintegrationservices/thread/4f29e3a3-fc8a-465c-8acc-12ecedfcb24c">“What&#8217;s the minimum configuration to run dtexec on windows 2003 server?”</a> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162810(v=SQL.105).aspx">DTEXEC</a> is the command line utility used behind the scenes to run SSIS packages. The question asker thought only the client tools needed to be installed, but I was not sure of this. Time to investigate!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I created two easy packages, called SimpleTest and AdvancedTest. SimpleTest reads a flat file, adds a timestamp and writes the results to another flat file.</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/simplepackage.PNG?mtime=1360669546"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/simplepackage.PNG?mtime=1360669546" alt="" width="152" height="206" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The AdvancedTest package reads the same flat file, but uses a term extraction component to do a term based analysis and it writes the results to a flat file. This package is used to see if there’s any difference when an Enterprise-only  component is used (see </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645993(v=sql.105).aspx">Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2008 R2</a><span style="text-align: justify;">).</span></p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/advancedpackage.PNG?mtime=1360669554"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/advancedpackage.PNG?mtime=1360669554" alt="" width="288" height="299" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The server is a Windows 2008R2 64-bit server. The edition of SQL Server being installed is SQL Server 2008R2 Developer edition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To test if DTEXEC is installed and if it works correctly, the following commands are used in a command window:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-size: small;">dtexec /F “c:SimpleTest.dtsx” &gt; SimpleLog.txt</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-size: small;">dtexec /F “c:AdvancedTest.dtsx” &gt; AdvancedLog.txt</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These commands execute a package located on the file system and output the results to a text file.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Client Tools only</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first install is the client tools, with which I mean BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) and SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). Later on I learned the question asker meant everything listed under <em>Shared Features</em>, which is a whole lot more than just the client tools. First I installed the Management Tools only.</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_Install.png?mtime=1360669453"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_Install.png?mtime=1360669453" alt="" width="490" height="369" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I took a look in the Program Folders, but I only found a 32-bit DTEXEC. Is this enough to run a package?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_Result.png?mtime=1360669459" alt="" width="435" height="189" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the DTEXEC statements are executed in a command window, we are greeted with the following error message:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Description: To run a SSIS package outside of Business Intelligence Development Studio you must install Standard Edition of Integration Services or higher.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So no luck with this method. When DTEXECUI is launched, everything is grayed out and another straightforward error message tells us we really do have to install Integration Services.</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_DTEXECUI.png?mtime=1360669438"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_DTEXECUI.png?mtime=1360669438" alt="" width="411" height="348" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">However, the Import/Export wizard is also installed. When I import a flat file to another flat file – the workflow used by the SimpleTest package – the wizard executes successfully:</span></p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_importwizard.png?mtime=1360669446"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ManagementTools_importwizard.png?mtime=1360669446" alt="" width="389" height="393" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The only reason DTEXEC was installed is to run the Import/Export wizard. Installing BIDS as well doesn’t solve the issue, as expected. You can run packages within BIDS, but I guess nobody is excited about staying up all night in order to manually kick off SSIS packages. So basically we have installed a lightweight development environment, but not a server.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SQL Server only</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stubborn as I am, I ignore the logical error messages I got earlier and I install the SQL Server database engine, without any shared feature whatsoever. This time the 64-bit DTEXEC is installed. We’re making progress. When I start the SimpleTest package, the log shows the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><em>The component &#8220;(DER) Add timestamp&#8221; (38) cannot run on installed (64-bit) of Integration Services. It requires Standard Edition (64-bit) or higher.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The error doesn’t make much sense, since I haven’t installed Integration Services at all and Developer Edition is a higher edition than Standard (in functionality, not in price). Running the AdvancedTest package results in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First we get a whole bunch of warning related to the registry, followed by errors related to the Term Extraction component, leading to a validation failure at the end. The Enterprise-only component leads to different errors, but the result is the same: we cannot run SSIS packages using DTEXEC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So why is DTEXEC installed? First of all, to run the 64-bit version of the Import/Export wizard, but also to support maintenance plans, who use SSIS behind the scenes. Since SQL Server 2005 sp2 or SQL Server 2008 CU1/sp1, it is not necessary to install SSIS to create maintenance plans. Read more about this in the blog post <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/tibor_karaszi/archive/2009/08/26/do-maintenance-plans-require-ssis.aspx">Do maintenance plans require SSIS?</a> by Tibor Karaszi (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/tibor_karaszi/default.aspx">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TiborKaraszi">twitter</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integration Services only</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now let’s try to do the sane thing here and install SSIS, without any other option specified.</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ssis_only_install.png?mtime=1360669468"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/ssis_only_install.png?mtime=1360669468" alt="" width="439" height="322" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">DTEXEC is installed, as expected of course, alongside the Integrations Services service. Running DTEXEC through the command line gives us the result we were hoping for:</span></p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/SSISonly_serviceON_dtexec_success.png?mtime=1360669481"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/SSISonly_serviceON_dtexec_success.png?mtime=1360669481" alt="" width="518" height="245" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">Success at last! DTEXECUI isn’t installed, indicating this is a client component only. This is OK, because you probably won’t ever use it on a server.</span></p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/SSISonly_nodtexecui.png?mtime=1360669475"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/DTEXEC_install/SSISonly_nodtexecui.png?mtime=1360669475" alt="" width="373" height="211" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">One final question remains: do we need the SSIS service? The answer is short: no. According to </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942176">Microsoft</a><span style="text-align: justify;">, the SSIS service only extends the functionality of SSMS, in the sense that it manages the storage of SSIS packages and that it monitors the running packages. So you can safely stop the service. However, you need to disable it as well; otherwise the service is started again once you run a package.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only when you want to set up a dedicated SSIS Server will you need to install Integration Services on its own, and if you do this you’ll need to store your packages on the file system. You can disable the Integration Services service; it is not needed to execute a package. You also might want to install the client connectivity tools as well and any other component you might need to connect to your sources.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asking me what I do for living could net you different answers, depending on what day you ask. Over the years, and through the course of several jobs, I have had a wide range of responsibilities that often stretched well beyond my current organizational role. I like to call these opportunities.</p>
<p>Recently I was considering the idea of building a virtual lab, as I&#8217;ve been worried that some of the varied experiences or skills I&#8217;ve picked up would rust away. While in Wisconsin visiting Ted Krueger (<a href="http://twitter.com/onpnt" title="Ted on Twitter">twitter</a> | <a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;author=68" title="Ted's blogs here">blog</a>) for <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/my-singing-not-so-good" title="SQL Saturday Chicago article">SQL Saturday Chicago</a>, I realized that the lab could serve two purposes. I could use it to not only regain or sharpen aging skills, but I could also use it to start blogging on more technical matters. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love process and personal improvement topics, but I need my tech fix too.</p>
<p>So here we are. If you don&#8217;t already have a virtual lab at work or home then I invite you to follow along with me as I build one. Each blog entry will have a general level of difficulty, from basic installation <img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/dr_beanie.png" alt="propeller beanie" /> to advanced administration <img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/dr_wizard.png" alt="wizard's hat" />. As the lab grows we will be installing a wide number of systems then later configuring and tuning them to meet different circumstances and needs. </p>
<p>Lets get started.</p>

<h2>Virtual Lab: Building the First Windows 2008 R2 Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>The purpose of today&#8217;s article is to create a basic windows virtual machine that can serve as a template for later virtual machines. Having a basic image or set of images on hand can dramatically speed up production and non-production roll-outs as well as ensure standardization of systems across your environment.<br />

</div>
<h2>Building the Lab Environment</h2>
<p>Building your own lab can be both fun and a learning experience. A virtual lab provides you a safe place to try new technologies and configurations. When you create a really horrendous set of configurations in your lab, your halls are going to be remarkably free of end users with torches and pitchforks. The risks you should never take in production environments, even production development systems, are fair game here. But first we have to build it.</p>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>First we should determine what type of environment we want to run and what types of technologies or systems we would like to play with. Some of you will be planning no working with just development software and/or database servers, some will be want to create a virtual business environment (DC, Exchange, AD, etc), and some will even want to play with a mixed operating system setup. Identifying some general requirements will also help when your lab (or the market) grows past the current list of technologies you want to try.</p>
<p>Here is a sample set of questions you should consider:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 2em;">
<li>What OS&#8217;s are you intending to run? Desktop, Server, Windows, Unix, Linux ?</li>
<li>What major software packages or technical areas are you intended to explore in the lab?</li>
<li>Will any of the systems be used for active development (ie, results will be ported directly to production)?</li>
<li>Will any of the systems potentially move to production?</li>
<li>Will any of the systems need to travel with you (between sites, work and home, or to conferences)?</li>
<li>Will your systems need to run only some of the time, all the time, or a mix?</li>
<li>Will they require network access to the outside world?</li>
<li>Will the outside world be allowed to access your lab resources?</li>
<li>Will you need a private network in your lab or can they coexist on your existing network?</li>
<li>Will there be interdependencies? (for instance, Server A is running DNS and Active Directory and has to be on for Server B to work properly)</li>
</ol>
<div class="mylab">
And some of the answers for my lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>My lab will be running multiple Windows servers and 1-2 linux systems</li>
<li>Software packages: SQL Server (of course), TFS, Active Directory, Sharepoint, potentially a DC, possibly Exchange, &#8230;pretty much anything in Microsoft&#8217;s catalog or that comes in as a user request is fair game</li>
<li>None of these systems will go to a production environment or be accessed by active development environments</li>
<li>The only environments that may need to travel are the SQL Server ones</li>
<li>None of the systems will need to run all of the time</li>
<li>The lab systems will be on a private network with limited external access</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Platform Selection</h3>
<p>Once we have an idea what we our lab will be used for, we need to determine what type of platform to use. If this is a home lab or you have limited space for equipment, you will probably want to go with a virtualization platform. Using a virtualization platform allows us to have a smaller physical (and electrical) footprint and multi-purpose our equipment, since many of our test servers will not need to be running when we aren&#8217;t directly using them. Virtualization also allows us to move systems to upgraded hosts if we later find ourselves having performance problems.</p>
<p>The hardware you use will depend on the types of answers you provided to the questions above. Using an old desktop might be a acceptable solution or you may need to incorporate higher end systems or even spare servers. My last setup (2007-2009) used an off-the-shelf Dell Precision work station as the host without any extra equipment or over-the-top upgrades. The system performed well as a low budget SQL Server and Windows server platform. On the other hand my new environment will need to support a far wider range and number of systems, so it will require higher performance hardware.</p>
<div class="mylab">
	Here is the current hardware setup for the lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: A Intel i7 920 quad-core</li>
<li>Memory: 10 GB of DDR3 RAM w/ room to upgrade up to 24GB</li>
<li>Storage #1: Raid 10 Array &#8211; (4) SATA2 7200RPM 500GB drives, mixed manufacturers</li>
<li>Storage #2: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vantec-NST-360SU-BK-3-5-Inch-External-Enclosure/dp/B000EDKO04/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1272804217&amp;sr=8-1" title="View at Amazon">Vantec external enclosure</a> w/ 500GB SATA2 drive (USB2/eSata) &#8211; raw storage for some backups, MSDN images, and other purchased software</li>
<li>Storage #3: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TWO-BAY-SATA-DOCKING-STATION/dp/B001UHQFVA/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1272804276&amp;sr=1-5" title="View at amazon">Bytecc two-bay docking station</a>  (USB2/eSata) &#8211; more disk (will be critical in a later article)</li>
</ul>
<p>	I have selected VMWare for my virtualization platform. There are a number of reasons for this (for instance, Microsoft hard-blocking virtual server installations on Windows 7) and I actually would have preferred MS Virtual Server, but such is life.
</p></div>
<h2>Installing our First Virtual Server</h2>
<p>From this point forward we will be working from the comfort of my home lab, so examples will be based on VMWare Server 2.1 and I will point out versions for other software as it is introduced. The purpose of this first virtual machine is to serve as a template for later machines, allowing me to build out one image that with a standard base configuration, installs all common services, then apply all the outstanding Windows updates. Though I will be using the term &#8216;template&#8217; in the article, this shouldn&#8217;t be confused with the template capability in VMware&#8217;s vSphere. </p>
<div class="hint">
In a production environment it is extremely helpful to have a basic server image already pre-configured and up to date. Not only does it provide a faster alternative to building each server from scratch, but it ensures that each server goes out with all of the required services and configurations and does so without adding a checklist to your process. Not that I am a <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/ITServiceManagement/there-is-never-time-for-part-3" title="Or maybe I am">process improvement fan</a> or anything.
</div>
<p>Though the software is different, many of the concepts will be similar if your lab is going to be based on Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 and I have successfully followed almost the same exact steps through Virtual Server in the past.</p>
<h3>Build the Server</h3>
<p>First we need to build our virtual machine. Opening the VMWare Server Host and logging in with administrative credentials, we are presented with a dashboard view of our system.</p>

<p>While it isn&#8217;t critical to pick a good name at this point, it couldn&#8217;t hurt either. Later as we create servers for specific purposes the VM names will reflect the actual names of their servers.</p>

	New VM &#8211; Provide a Name
	</div>
<p>In my case I intend to use Windows 2008 R2 as my main server environment, so this basic image will reflect that in it&#8217;s name and I will choose the Windows 2008 option from the operating systems tab. Before choosing the 64-bit image I made sure to run the <a href="http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/datacenter_downloads/vmware_server/2_0#drivers_tools" title="Available from VMWare Server Tools section">64-bit compatibility check</a> offered by VMWare to ensure I could run a 64-bit guest on my host. If you are using Virtual Server 2005 then you will be limited to 32-bit guests so be sue you buy/download the correct versions.</p>

<p>For this first server I am going to allocate 4GB of RAM for use during the installation process. When making later copies of the system we will tune these values accordingly. As I intend to use these systems in a lab environment and may need the images to be portable to another single core system, I&#8217;m going to select the 1 CPU option. For later articles we may create 2- or 4-CPU options, but for most of our non-production needs a 1-CPU system will be sufficient. While technically it would be possible to &#8220;tune&#8221; the CPU setting at a later time, since we really only care about the hard-drive file at this point, changing CPU architectures on a system after installation ranges from tricky to absurdly-painful-with-no-hope-of-working.</p>

<p>The final lasting decision (though not the last step) is how large we want to make the virtual drive and whether we want to allocate the space ahead of time or use a growth model. In my last environment I pre-allocated space for my base windows installation and then attached or created secondary drives for the installed applications. In this case, Microsoft is suggesting <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/system-requirements.aspx" title="Windows 2008 R2 Requirements">a minimum of 32GB of space</a> and, while I don&#8217;t want to give up the space, I&#8217;ve decided to use pre-allocation again to simplify the process.</p>

	New VM &#8211; Drive Settings

<p>The final options, optical drive access and network method, are only going to be used for this image during the Windows installation process. Later copies will again have values assigned based on the project or technology that&#8217;s being installed. For the purposes of the installation we will use an ISO file for the optical drive and bridged networking.</p>
<div class="hint">When you install VMWare initially it will ask for a folder for your standard store (default is &#8220;C:Virtual Machines&#8221; on Windows). ISOs placed in this folder will be available for mounting in VMWare or you can create a new store that points to a folder elsewhere. Having a dedicated drive for software storage, I created an &#8216;MSDN Library&#8217; store and pointed it to that location.</div>

Firefox 3.6 is documented as not working with the console viewer right now, so you are going to have to downgrade or switch to IE. 3-3.5 also had issue at one point but there are either fixes or workarounds for this.

<h3>Install the OS</h3>
<p>We are now ready to turn our machine on for the first time and install Windows. This part is actually fairly boring, which is yet another reason that we want to limit how many times we have to do it.</p>
<div class="mylab">
This is the point I ran into an issue with VMWare&#8217;s console. VMWare continued to present me with a black screen when I opened the console. I believe the change that fixed this issue was setting the DNS address on the vmnet1 network connection, but it could just as easily have been the firewall being turned off when VMWare started or the couple changes I made to IE&#8217;s trusted sites. An excellent, practical example of why you should always make one change at a time and write down what you changed when you are troubleshooting a systems problem.
</div>
<p>The first decision the installer requires is selection between the various versions of Windows. Based on the options available, the trade-offs outlined in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/r2-editions-overview.aspx" title="See the feature comparison">the feature comparison</a>, and the fact that I have already written down my MSDN Enterprise key, I will be installing Enterprise edition. I&#8217;m not actually sure how long the installation took, I wandered off and found something else to do for a while (Peanut butter jelly time, peanut b&#8230;oh). I&#8217;ve installed windows a few more times than your average developer, so my bet is on 39 minutes. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

The default Windows password policy is probably going to annoy you if you haven&#8217;t run into it before. It will not tell you what the policy is when your password fails and the policy itself is well-defined. In a production environment one of our first steps would likely be to change it to meet our business needs or current setup.</p>
<p>Official policy information can be found <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc264456.aspx" title="Windows 2008 Password Policy Settings">here</a>

<p>After the initial login there are a couple key things we should do prior to starting the update cycle. First we are going to install the VMWare tools to make the interface easier to use and second, we are going to increase the screen resolution.</p>

<p>After these two tasks we will begin by applying service packs (none for Windows 2008 R2 at this time) and then windows updates. Windows 2008 offers a handy dashboard to manage these tasks on the first install and, being lazy, I&#8217;m not going to turn it down.</p>

If you haven&#8217;t worked with server much in the past you may be surprised by a strange dialog when you attempt to restart your system. When you shutdown or reboot a server it asks you to provide a reason and note, I advise that you get in the habit of always typing up a short note on why you are shutting down or rebooting. It only takes a few seconds and one day it&#8217;s going to save you hours because these notes are entered into the event log before the system shuts down.
</div>
<p>Next I am going to glance through the features and see if there any others that I would want installed on all of my servers. In this case the only one I can see if SNMP, so a quick installation and configuration and we are ready to move on.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .8em; margin-bottom: 1em;">

	Server Features &#8211; Configuring SNMP
	</div>
<div class="hint">
Installing SNMP services as part of your basic image gives you the opportunity to ensure you have consistent coverage and passwords across all your systems, which in turn makes deployment easier when it comes time to point your network or systems monitoring software at the new server.
</div>
<p>The step we might normally move on to in a production or corporate environment is installation of base antivirus, client license, or and inventory management software client. This is an excellent time to install software packages that are part of your standard or that can be pre-installed and updated later. Another consideration would be whether you need to set up VNC, RDP, or another remoting technology.</p>
<p>The last item on my personal setup list is to assign a background image and set up BGInfo. Having a common background and system information on every server is extremely handy and helps show critical information at a glance (like disk usage or IP addresses). An easy solution is a utility called BGInfofrom SysInternals. BGInfo is <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897557.aspx" title="BGInfo at Technet">a free download</a> and there are many examples and articles available on the internet for setting it up.</p>

<div class="mylab">
Once upon a time I had scripts and standard layouts to add other interesting information to the background (such as uptime counters and such), but that can wait for another day. For this initial example I have grouped the information in a way that is meaningful for me, but haven&#8217;t done anything fancy.
