				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mix 09 really turned out to be quite an event, a lot of cool new stuff was announced. </p>
<h2>ASP.NET MVC 1.0</h2>
<p>The first thing I saw was ASP.NET MVC 1.0. I have been waiting for this for a while now since I want to do a MVC site for some stuff at work and don&#8217;t want to deal with CTP or RC releases. Now that it is finalized I finally can start working on that. You can download ASP.NET MVC 1.0 here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=53289097-73ce-43bf-b6a6-35e00103cb4b&amp;displaylang=en</p>
<h2>Silverlight 3</h2>
<p>The biggest announcement I would say about Silverlight 3 is that you can go Out-of-Browser. This is of course a direct attack on Adobe AIR which has a ton of desktop clients. Check out the following post to see how simple this is: <a href="http://wildermuth.com/2009/03/18/Enabling_Out-of-Browser_Support_in_Silverlight_3">Enabling Out-of-Browser Support in Silverlight 3</a></p>
<p>Here is a screen shot<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/images/Silverlight3OutofBrowser_NEW_web.jpg" alt="Silverlight 3 Out Of Browser" title="Silverlight 3 Out Of Browser" /></p>
<p>Here is what Microsoft says about Silverlight 3 Out Of Browser<br />
The new out-of-browser experience in Silverlight 3 Beta enables users to place their favorite Silverlight applications directly onto any PC or Mac desktop, start menu or application folder, without the need to download an additional runtime or browser plug-in. Further, the new experience enables Silverlight applications to work whether the computer is connected to the Internet or not – a radical improvement to the traditional Web experience. </p>
<p><strong>Silverlight 3 Bitmap API and Shader Effects</strong><br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/images/Silverlight3BitmapAPIandShaderEffects_thumb.jpg" alt="Silverlight 3 Bitmap API and Shader Effects" title="Silverlight 3 Bitmap API and Shader Effects" /></p>
<p>With Silverlight 3 Beta, users can now write pixels to a bitmap. Thus, they can build a photo editor to do red-eye correction, perform edits on scanned documents or create specials effects for cached bitmaps from elements on the screen. Shader effects include blur and drop shadow.</p>
<p>Download Silverlight 3 Beta here: http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight3/default.aspx</p>
<p>Silverlight 3 Beta Fact Sheet: http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/docs/Silverlight3FS.doc</p>
<h2>Expression Blend 3</h2>
<p>Expression Blend 3 has a ton of cool stuff, here is a little description of some of these features</p>
<p><strong>Expression Blend 3 SketchFlow Feature</strong><br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/images/ExpressionBlend3SketchFlowFeature_web.jpg" alt="Expression Blend 3 SketchFlow" title="Expression Blend 3 SketchFlow" /><br />
The SketchFlow feature in Expression Blend 3 allows designers to demonstrate concepts effectively by enabling them to follow multiple paths through a concept, test different scenarios and provide comments in context by annotating their experience.</p>
<p><strong>Expression Blend 3 Photoshop Import Feature</strong><br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/images/ExpressionBlend3PhotoshopImportFeature_web.jpg" alt="Expression Blend 3 Photoshop Import" title="Expression Blend 3 Photoshop Import" /><br />
Expression Blend 3 delivers a Photoshop import feature, which enables designers to generate design time sample data within Expression Blend or import it from an XML file, making it easy to build data-connected applications without access to live data. Users can easily switch between using sample data and using live data at run-time.</p>
<p>Download Expression Blend 3 Preview here: http://expression.microsoft.com/en-us/dd565875.aspx</p>
<h2>Internet Explorer 8</h2>
<p>Internet Explorer 8 can be downloaded in 25 languages at http://www.microsoft.com/ie8 starting at noon EDT on March 19. There is a ton of new stuff in IE8, I have been using the RC versions for a while now and I must say that I really like it. It is definitely much faster than IE7 and IE6</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer 8 Accelerator</strong><br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/windowsvista/images/ie8Accelerator_web.jpg" alt="Internet Explorer 8 Accelerator" title="Internet Explorer 8 Accelerator" /><br />
Accelerators make it faster and easier to perform common tasks online by making Web-based services such as ESPN.com, Live Search and Sina available for use directly from the page people are viewing. Users can simply right-click a word or phrase and instantly map, e-mail, or share it.</p>
<p><strong>Web Slices</strong><br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/windowsvista/images/ie8WebSlice_web.jpg" alt="Internet Explorer 8 Web Slices" title="Internet Explorer 8 Web Slices" /><br />
Web Slices in Internet Explorer 8 makes favorite information from sites such as Digg, Yahoo! Mail, OneRiot, and eBay instantly available wherever someone goes on the Web.</p>
<p><strong>Domain Highlighting and Tab Coloring</strong><br />
<br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/windowsvista/images/ie8tabcolor_web.jpg" alt="Internet Explorer 8 Domain Highlighting and Tab Coloring" title="Internet Explorer 8 Domain Highlighting and Tab Coloring" /><br />
Domain Highlighting is a nice feature because you can tell right away if you are on a fake site or on the real ebay site since that will be highlighted</p>
<p>So that is it for day one, I will update this post after day 2 starts</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to do a little test on one of my machines with the three browsers I use most. In each browser I opened up <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?tab=ym">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/?cnn=yes">CNNMoney</a>.<br />
I did this on Friday and did not look at the memory usage until Monday. After a little less than 3 days, we get the following numbers</p>
<p><strong>Chromium 1.0.154.48</strong><br />
180,157k</p>
<p><strong>IE 8.00.6001.18372</strong><br />
362,223k</p>
<p><strong>Firefox 3.0.4</strong><br />
100,148k</p>
<p>Looking at these numbers makes you think that Google wrote Gmail and Google Reader in such a way that it on purpose made Internet Explorer leak memory like a bucket without a bottom.</p>
<pre>If IE 
   then leak memory 
else 
   behave normally</pre>
<p>I don&#8217;t know but this is just crazy, don&#8217;t come to me either saying that IE8 is beta, so what, this is insane! IE8 uses 362MB while FireFox 3 only uses 100MB. Chrome compared to Firefox uses almost double the memory. Chrome + FireFox combine still use 80MB less than Internet Explorer 8</p>
<p>Below is a screen shot of what memory usage looks like</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/3322981762/" title="FireFox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 8 Memory Usage"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3594/3322981762_be28114019_o.jpg" width="654" height="192" alt="Browsers" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, January 26 at 12pm PT, Internet Explorer 8 Release Candidate 1 (RC1) will be released to tech and consumer enthusiasts in a total of 25 languages.</p>
<p>Users should visit www.microsoft.com/ie8</p>
<p>IT Professionals should visit http://technet.microsoft.com/ie</p>

<p>Since Beta 2, you’ll note some of the changes in RC1 include the following:</p>
<p><strong>ClickJacking protection</strong>.  The SmartScreen Filter now includes the ability to help detect and prevent “ClickJacking” which is a malicious technique of tricking web users into revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer.</p>
<p><strong>InPrivate™</strong>. Helps to protect user’s data and privacy from being retained “locally” on a PC. InPrivate Browsing and InPrivate Filtering can now be used independently.</p>
<p><strong>Performance improvements</strong>. Reduces the time that users must wait when starting the browser, opening a “new tab”, or loading a page.</p>
<p><strong>User interface and experience updates</strong>. There have been several user interface changes to help ensure a better user experience.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 8 RC1 will be available in 25 languages including: Arabic, Chinese (Traditional, Simplified and Hong Kong), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Polish, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Swedish</p>

<p>I still think that InPrivate should have been named PornMode  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
