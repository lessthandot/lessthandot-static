				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/2014/champagne.jpg?mtime=1389043764"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/2014/champagne.jpg?mtime=1389043764" width="156" height="157" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a bit late with the almost obligatory “How was my past year and how do I think next year is going to rock” blog post – we’re already a good week into the new year – but without further ado I present you: How was my past year and how do I think next year is going to rock!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify;">2013 was not a bad year professional wise. I had set some goals and I managed to reach most of them (which is quite a miracle, because I excel at abandoning New Year’s resolutions at the very first chance possible). I laid those goals out in the blog post </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/other/happy-holidays">Happy Holidays</a><span style="text-align: justify;">. I read more technical books. Not 12 like I wanted to, but almost 10. Those books were the following:</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20pt; list-style-position: outside;">
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Server-2012-Analysis-Services/dp/0735658188/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356599212&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tabular+modeling+ssas">Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services: The BISM Tabular Model</a> by Marco Russo, Alberto Ferrari and Chris Webb. It’s a great reference on the SSAS Tabular model and DAX, but it is sometimes a difficult read.</li>
<li>Information Dashboard Design, Data Visualization: a successful design process and Say it with Charts. I wrote a review about those 3 books <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/book-review/data-visualization-book-review">here</a>. Three great books who got me up to speed with data visualization. In the summer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-At---Glance/dp/1938377001/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040589&amp;sr=8-1">second edition</a> of Information Dashboard Design came out and I immediately bought it and read it front to cover. It’s a great book and offers a few extras over the first edition.</li>
<li>I was browsing a local book store and I found those two books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Intelligence-Microsoft-Techniques-Visualizing/dp/1118388038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040636&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mark+stacey">Visual Intelligence: Microsoft Tools and Techniques for Visualizing Data</a> by Mark Stacey, Joe Salvatore and Adam Jorgensen and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Excel-Charts-Graphs-MrExcel-Library/dp/0789748622/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040735&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=excel+charts">Excel 2013 Charts and Graphs</a> by Bill Jelen. Actually I just went home and bought the books at Amazon, because those local bookstores sure aren’t cheap. I had the pleasure of meeting Mark in person at the Belgian SQL Server Days and he’s an awesome chap. It’s a great book he wrote and I absolutely recommend it as a great overview of all the Microsoft BI visualization options. It even gives you a taste of HTML5. Sadly, Power BI was announced after the release of the book. The Excel book was quite nice as well. A bit dry, but a very good reference if you want to find out what you can do with Excel (a lot).</li>
<li>Also in the summer time a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Dimensional/dp/1118530802/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040993&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=data+warehouse+toolkit">new edition of the Data Warehouse Toolkit</a> by Ralph Kimball was released. I read it and it was great to freshen up my knowledge on dimensional design. If you didn’t read any of the previous editions yet, this book is an absolute must-read.</li>
<li>Since my (ex-) colleague Valentino did the technical review, I was very keen to do a <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/ssrs/reporting-services-blueprints">review</a> of the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sql-server-2012-reporting-services-blueprints/book?utm_source=mention.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=book_mention.com">SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services Blueprints</a>. A very fast read and great to get up to speed with SSRS.</li>
<li>I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Balanced-Scorecard-Translating-Strategy/dp/0875846513/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389041329&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=balanced+scorecard">The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action</a> by Robert Kaplan and David Norton. It is a fundamental book regarding scorecards and performance management, but it was way too “financial” for me (read: I almost fell asleep reading the book). So I gave up half-way. No shame in that, I might finish it in the future when I’m overdosing on Red Bull.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently I started the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Schema-The-Complete-Reference/dp/0071744320/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389041477&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=star+schema">Star Schema The Complete Reference</a> by Chris Adamson. It was recommended by a colleague and it looks very promising. This will be my first book of 2014 and I hope I can reach 12 books in total.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the other goals: I got the <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/MSSQLServer/how-i-prepared-mcse">MCSE certification</a>, learned a lot about SQL Server 2012,<a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/other/the-times-they-are-a"> changed jobs and started writing articles</a>. The blog went all right in my opinion: I managed to squeak out 40 blog posts, with the most popular blog post at the time of writing being <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/business-intelligence-1/sql-2014-ctp1-where-is">SQL 2014 CTP1, where is my BIDS?</a> with over 31000 views for the moment. I had a couple of beers when I wrote that post, so this seems to be worth for further investigation to see if I can repeat that success formula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What does the year bring in 2014, aside from the 20-year anniversary of Kurt Cobains death? (Yes, we are that old). I will try to keep this blog running of course, next to the articles, and I will try to present again at a few events. SQL Server 2014 is coming up, so I’m sure there will be plenty of stuff to learn and discover. I will also try to get a better grip on data vault modelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, thanks for reading all those posts in 2013 and I hope you return in the following year. Have a great 2014!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was working on my resolution post yesterday and was going to post it on my personal blog here: http://denisgobo.blogspot.com/<br />
I noticed last night on my <a href="http://twitter.com/DenisGobo">twitter</a> feed that <a href="http://twitter.com/statisticsio/status/1085387187">Jason Massie</a> tagged me here:<br />
My list is more a to-do list for the year than a resolution, since I am as perfect as Chrissie1 having a resolution would mean I wasn’t perfect, this clearly isn’t so.</p>
<p>Here is what I intend to do in 2009</p>
<p><strong>Reading more books (at least 2 books a month)</strong><br />
When I commuted to New York City from Princeton I read about 60 books a year. This was easily accomplished because my commute was about an hour each way. Now that I have a 6 minute commute this becomes a little harder. I have three kids under the age of five; two of them just entered their terrible two stage. While they are awake you cannot read because you want to spend some time with them, then there is the wife who doesn’t want to be ignored either. Luckily I don’t watch that much TV a week, maybe 3 hours max. All this leaves me with about 4 or 5 hours to read per week at home. I could read at work during lunch for 30 minutes a day and surf the other 30 minutes. I don’t know yet how this will work out but somehow I hope I can manage it.</p>
<p><strong>Answering at least 10 questions a day on various sites</strong><br />
This should be no problem; I should be able to do this at lunch, before I start working and just before I leave to go home. I still think participating in newsgroups is one of the best ways to learn and keep up to date on a technology</p>
<p><strong>Learning Powershell</strong><br />
I have played around for a little with PowerShell lately and must say that I really like it, since it now also comes with SQL Server 2008 there is no reason not to learn it. I can already see where I can use it for a couple of different things</p>
<p><strong>Mastering C#</strong><br />
I admit I am not nearly as good in C# as in SQL; this is of course because 90% of the time I am using SQL Server and not C#. I would like to change that by diving deeper into the language itself, I purchased 3 C# books last month and will read them and do all the examples. Just in case you wonder what those 3 books are, they are listed below<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988363?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1933988363">C# in Depth</a><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321485890?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0321485890">More Effective C#: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your C#</a><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321562992?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0321562992">The C# Programming Language (3rd Edition)</a> </p>
<p><strong>Finishing the SQL admin hacks </strong><br />
This is another thing I just can’t seem to finish, I wrote the <a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=306">SQL Server Programming Hacks</a> in the first half of this year; I started the <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/SQL_Server_Admin_Hacks">SQL Server Admin Hacks</a> the second half of this year but I am just pushing it off. just like Peter in Office Space I am thinking &#8220;Where is the motivation Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is it for me, I will add some personal stuff to this on my <a href="http://denisgobo.blogspot.com/">personal blog</a></p>
<p>Who to tag, who to tag? Mmmm, can&#8217;t tag Chrissie1 since he is perfect, let me try the following people:<br />
<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a><br />
<a href="http://www.alexcuse.com/">Alex Cuse</a><br />
