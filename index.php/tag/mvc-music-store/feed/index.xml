				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I succumbed to the urge to upgrade my customized version of <a href="/index.php/All/mvc+music+store:" title="All LTD blog posts on MVC Music Store">MVC Music store</a> from ASP.Net MVC3 to MVC4. I had just finished watching Steve Sanderson&#8217;s excellent TechDays 2012 session, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDays/Techdays-2012-the-Netherlands/2287" title="C#5, ASP.NET MVC 4, and asynchronous Web applications on Channel9">C#5, ASP.NET MVC 4, and asynchronous Web applications</a> (if you&#8217;re doing ASP.Net MVC and haven&#8217;t watched it, queue it up, awesome presentation). During the presentation, Steve used Apache Bench to show the improvements as he upgraded his small project from synchronous MVC4 to asynchronous MVC4, which got me wondering what effect MVC4 and Asynchronous MVC4 would show during the <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-adding-the-load" title="Continuous Delivery - Adding the Load testing Stage">wcat load test step</a> in my MVC Music Store build process.</p>
<h2>The Upgrade to MVC4</h2>
<p>Upgrading from MVC3 to MVC4 was easy. I followed the instructions from the <a href="http://www.asp.net/whitepapers/mvc4-release-notes#_Toc303253806">MVC4 release notes</a> and committed my changes. </p>
<p>I installed Visual Studio 2012 on my build server (including .Net 4.5) so the build would run. Installing a copy on build servers is allowed under visual studio licensing models and while some people try to create a &#8216;pure&#8217; non-VS build experience, I think the only advantage one gets from this model is ensuring the production application is compiled in a different manner from the one the developers built and tested under.</p>
<p>VS upgraded, .Net upgraded, MVC upgraded, time to commit and push.</p>
<p>Build running, deploying for smoke test, failed. Page Won&#8217;t Load.</p>
<h3>Still Copying MVC3 DLLs to Build Output</h3>
<p>The CI build step runs the build and creates a publishable package that will be archived for all later build stages and final deployment. The last step of the CI stage deploys the package to a VM and does an HTTP GET on the front page, just to ensure it&#8217;s deployable. Turns out the site deployed fine, but the front page refused to display.</p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/MVC4/folders.png" alt="Project folders" style="margin: .5em .5em .5em 0; float: left;" />Deploying MVC3 early on took advantage of a special folder named _bin_deployableAssemblies, so MSBuild was overwriting the MVC4 assemblies with the contents of this folder (MVC3) and then giving me errors on the razor stack when I tried to actually load the page. The build server didn&#8217;t mind because it was using either GAC&#8217;d or Reference Assemblies instead of the local DLLs.</p>
<p>I initially delete the folder to fix this, which turned out to be overkill because I also had SQL Server CE assemblies in there. The final result was to clear out just the MVC3 assemblies from the folder, leaving the SQL Server CE ones.</p>
<p>I ran several builds through the load test step, with interesting results that I&#8217;ll show at the bottom.</p>
<h2>The Upgrade to Asynchronous</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to call my changes hacky. In a prior post, I <a href="/index.php/DesktopDev/MSTech/CSharp/pick-the-right-storage-all" title="Pick the Right Storage: All SQL is Not Equal">switched SQL CE for full SQL Server</a> to fix a performance bottleneck. With the known bottleneck removed, I wasn&#8217;t sure what the current one was or if  Asynchronous MVC would improve things further, but I had high hopes.</p>
<p>You can see the final result on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.main/src" title="MVCMusicStore.Main on BitBucket">BitBucket</a>, but here&#8217;s a sample of the quick and dirty surgery:</p>
<p><b>MVCMusicStore.Main / MvcMusicStore / Controllers / HomeController.cs</b> (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.main/src/a3f3c943c685906a8986c2ce94c79db8bc04a577/MvcMusicStore/Controllers/HomeController.cs?at=default" title="File on BitBucket">see file</a>)</p>

<p>Each action has been converted to an async method returning a Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; and my ControllerBase object now inherits from AsyncController instead of Controller.</p>
<p>Because the query logic for this application is spread all over the place (which is common for entity framework in my experience), in some places I have tidy await calls to Async methods (like in the IndexAsync method above), and in some cases I have an inline await Task.Factory call (GetTopSellingAlbumsAsync action). <a href="http://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Roadmap" title="Entity Framework Roadmap">Entity Framework 6</a> will have asynchronous Query and Save capabilities, but I personally don&#8217;t care much for Entity Framework, so it&#8217;s unlikely I&#8217;ll go through the effort of upgrading this project from EF4 to EF6. In the meantime, I have added my own SaveAsync call to the IMusicStoreEntities interface and DbContext implementation and have added some dirty await/async calls throughout the codebase.</p>
<p>Final result? </p>
<h2>Graphs and Numbers, woohoo!</h2>
<p>So what happened when I upgrade to MVC4? faster, slower, &#8230; ? And how much faster did Asynchronous actions make it? 1 order of magnitude? 2 orders?</p>
<p>What happened was object lessons in why having load measurements are useful and why identifying your performance bottlenecks is critical, instead of treating asynchronous actions as magic pixie dust.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
   <img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/MVC4/rate.png" alt="Load test - Request Rates" />
</div>
<p>On the left side of this graph you can see that the MVC 3 rate has averaged 75 requests/second with a pretty high level of variability. Switching to MVC4 moved us to a much more consistent 95-100 requests/second average, then throwing async in the mix reduced the rate to the 80&#8217;s. In each case, the requests are all of the files our browser would request when we browse the index page, select a genre to the genre page, select an album to the album page, and then check out, so some of this is dynamic content and some is static image and script files.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
   <img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/MVC4/responseTime.png" alt="Load test - Response Times" />
</div>
<p>The other interesting number is the lack of difference in Response Times. Somehow MVC4 unlocked more throughput for the system without impacting the Response Time for those requests. There was also no change at all in Response Times at all after adding Async actions, something that underlines and bolds the fact that the database calls were not the performance bottleneck for these test VMs.</p>
<h2>I Should Upgrade to MVC4 Now!</h2>
<p>Well, yes, you should, but don&#8217;t expect a matching 30% performance improvement. This improvement was in my test systems which are all VMs residing on the same Hyper-V server, running simulated loads that don&#8217;t match what real traffic would look like on a real site with real networks and real servers. That being said, the point of the load test step is to let me know when something significant occurs and there was definitely a measurable, positive performance improvement when I performed the upgrade. Given the fact that I don&#8217;t have a pouch of magic pixie dust, I have to assume that either MVC 4 or .Net 4.5 made some improvements.</p>
<p>The moral of the async upgrade is to be aware of your assumptions. In the real world, had I made async-ified my codebase to get a performance improvement, I would have just added a great deal of extra code complexity for a net loss in performance. There was no science to my guess that async would make things faster, it was pure guesswork.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While re-implementing my continuous delivery pipeline in TeamCity <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-with-teamcity" title="Continuous Delivery with TeamCity" target="_blank">last week</a>, I skipped over charting the load tests results from WCAT. This weekend I returned to this task to find that it was less tricky than it originally appeared.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>TeamCity has project and build level custom charting that is driven by settings files. These files and the format of the necessary chart definition are <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Custom+Chart" title="Custom Charts on TeamCity 7" target="_blank">documented</a>. The actual graph XML is pretty straightforward and easy to implement. The files refer to values that are provided by TeamCity (listed on that page), via a special file you drop during your build (<a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-provideStatsUsingFile" title="teamcity-info.xml Details" target="_blank">teamcity-info.xml</a>), or via <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-ReportingBuildStatistics" title="Service Message Details" target="_blank">service messages</a>.</p>
<h2>Graph Definitions</h2>
<p>In the Jenkins build I had graphed the following data from the WCAT run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rate Graph &#8211; Transactions Per Second, Requests Per Second</li>
<li>Totals Graph &#8211; Total Transaction count, Total Request count, Total Error count</li>
<li>Response Time to Last Byte Graph &#8211; Minimum, Average, 95th Percentile, 99th Percentile, Maximum</li>
</ul>
<p>To match this in TeamCity I created the project-wide graph settings like so:</p>

<p>Besides the key in each valueType tag, I also include a buildTypeid that is the internal build ID for my automated load test build. I found this in the address bar after clicking the build&#8217;s link on the dashboard:</p>

<h2>Defining the Data</h2>
<p>Once I have the definitions roughly the way I want them, I need to make the data available from the WCAT run. WCAT already produces it&#8217;s results in XML and for Jenkins I created an XSL to transform the results into a new XML file that would be easier to plot in Jenkins. For TeamCity I&#8217;ll do the same, but this time I decided to use powershell to execute the transformation.</p>
<p>The WCAT results take some work to decode, as they are stored in XML that is halfway to presentation format. Luckily I have already done this once, so creating a new XSL is fairly easy:</p>

<p>The powershell command to run the transform is then as easy as:</p>

<p>TeamCity replaces the variables with the correct values and transforms the generated log into the specially named &#8220;teamcity-info.xml&#8221; file.</p>
<h2>Done</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t happy about editing settings file in TeamCity directly, especially given the implications this has in a real environment (how many people would need to be involved to do this in a heavily audited environment?). However that was the only issue I had and I am happy with the results (the build versions are the same because I rebuilt several times so I would have a decent chart):</p>

<p>For bonus points, the same functionality you have with the built-in charts is available here. You can change the time period, view averages of the values, and change which points are graphed by checking or unchecking them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So what do you do when you have a nice little build lab with two  parallel automated deployment pipelines that include unit testing, interface testing, deployments, smoke testing, load testing, static analysis, and automated sort-of QA and production deployments? </p>
<p>Take it to the cloud, of course. </p>
<p>(Well, and write <a href="/index.php/All/continuous+delivery:" title="Continuous Delivery posts">a bunch of blog posts</a> and <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli%27s_Continuous_Delivery_Project" title="Continuous Delivery project wiki page">a wiki page</a> too)</p>
<h2>Azure Setup</h2>
<p>The target of this exercise was to get the project deploying automatically to the cloud, and I wasn&#8217;t particular about where. I decided that the <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/" title="About the Azure Websites Feature">free website</a> feature in Azure would be a good target. Mostly due to the free part but also because I suspected it would be easy.</p>
<p>First up was creating an Azure account, which I did via <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/" title="WindowsAzure.com">WindowsAzure.com</a>. The Web Sites feature is still in Preview mode, so I had to go the preview features and enable it.</p>

<p>Once it&#8217;s enabled, I can go into the portal and when I press the &#8220;New&#8221; button at the bottom, I&#8217;ll have options to create a new Web Site instance.</p>

<p>After creating the new site, it will provision and show up in my dashboard:</p>

</div>
<p>That&#8217;s all it takes to have a new Web Site in Windows Azure. Of course it&#8217;s not doing anything useful at the moment, so lets go back to the build process and fix that.</p>
<h2>Build Process Changes</h2>
<p>Because I chose to use an Azure Web Site, the build changes are going to be minimal. Microsoft intends us to use the Publish feature in Visual Studio or Web Matrix to deploy our websites, so they give us all the settings we need to run the msdeploy executable from a build step instead. </p>
<p>In the properties dashboard for the new website above, there is a link to download the publish settings for the site and a link to setup credentials. First setup the credentials, then click the download link to download the publish settings. These settings are intended for Visual Studio or Web Matrix, but being XML we can read the file and pluck out the important values.</p>
<p>I made a copy of my final &#8220;Deploy to Production&#8221; step and modified the msdeploy step to use a new Param file. The Param file is used during the deployment to set the IIS name and connection strings, you can see all of them on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.main/src/1560a5fd57ea/Configs" title="Parameter files at tarwn/MVCMusicStore.Main">BitBucket</a>. </p>

<p>I then updated the Configuration Parameters to reflect the Azure credentials and URL so the deployment and smoke test would work properly and entered the username and password entered in the Azure Dashboard in the prior step.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it, probably the fastest on premises to cloud change. Press the build button in TeamCity and we have a green build to the cloud:</p>

<p>And after a similar set of changes in Jenkins, I have a parallel production step that targets Azure as well:</p>

<p>And of course I had to push the button a few times:</p>

<p>You can see the site here: http://elismvcmusicstore.azurewebsites.net/</p>
<p><em>Note: It will probably load slowly. It&#8217;s on a shared node and seems to go to sleep since it gets visited so infrequently. If I felt like paying for it, it&#8217;s just a toggle button away from running as a reserved instance (and another to scale it up to multiple instances)</em></p>
<h2>That was the easy button version</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that I chose the easiest possible target, as long as we can script the deployment we can easily add it into the pipeline and know that our deployment is taking exactly the same steps every time it deploys. Whether we were instead deploying to an Azure web role, deploying EC2 instances, or pushing to another provider, we have the framework to do so consistently and safely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the series of 12 posts, I have built a <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli%27s_Continuous_Delivery_Project" title="Continuous Delivery wiki post" target="_blank">continuous delivery pipeline</a> around the MVC Music Store tutorial web site. The journey included making changes to support unit testing, creating a CI build, adding automated multi-environment deployment, automated interface testing, automated load testing stage, and static analysis. Up until now, this was entirely on <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" title="Jenkins CI website" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>, but today I intend to re-implement the pipeline on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" title="TeamCity by JetBrains" target="_blank">TeamCity</a>.</p>
<h2>General Feelings</h2>
<p>My general feelings towards TeamCity during this process have been good. I found several places where TeamCity would have been easier to use [than Jenkins], such as parsing test result files and evaluating results. I like the visibility of pending changes for each build step and everything I have implemented has been extremely straightforward (though I haven&#8217;t taken on custom graphs and code coverage yet). Wiring together dependencies was far easier and clearer then in Jenkins, and the build-level configurations and sharing of build numbers throughout the build was a lot cleaner. Little touches like previews for the artifacts and working directories were also extremely handy.</p>
<p>Not everything was perfect, however. The build chains were as close as I could get to a pipeline visualization and they are busier then the pipeline view in Jenkins. There also wasn&#8217;t an obvious way to use a build chain view for the dashboard. Rerunning steps in the build would create a whole new chain, rather then being treated as a retry of a prior run of the same snapshot. The plugins don&#8217;t feel quite as first class in TeamCity as they did in Jenkins, but the built in functionality was quite a bit more extensive, so I think this just comes down to focus and my own experience (or lack) with the tools. </p>
<p>But enough of my feelings, lets do some technical stuff.</p>
<h2>Review of the Build Process</h2>
<p>The build pipeline is the process the code goes through from committing the code to eventual delivery, automated where possible to minimize the lead time for new features and wire in good practices I want to follow. The code is built and passes through a variety of tests and checks at each step, with only a few configurations changing along the way, ensuring what is released has passed every step as quickly and consistently as possible (smooth is fast). </p>
<p>The current Jenkins build pipeline looks like this (plus lots of static analysis that doesn&#8217;t fit in the picture):</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_load.png" title="Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Load Test Step" /><br />
	Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Load Test Step
</div>
<p>These are the portion I intend to do in TeamCity:</p>
<dl>
<dt>CI Stage</dt>
<dd>Monitors main code repository, execute build, run unit tests, deploy to ensure deployable, smoke test deployment</dd>
<dt>Interface Testing</dt>
<dd>Monitors interface test code repository, deploys + smoke tests deployment, runs interface tests</dd>
<dt>Load Testing</dt>
<dd>Monitors load test code repository, deploys + smoke tests deployment, runs load test</dd>
<dt>QA Deploy</dt>
<dd>Manual QA deployment for imaginary QA department</dd>
<dt>Prod Deploy</dt>
<dd>Manual production deployment</dd>
</dl>
<p>I will be leaving the load test results graph and <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-adding-static-analysis" title="Continuous Delivery - Adding Static Analysis" target="_blank">static analysis</a> until a later post.</p>
<h2>Server Setup</h2>
<p>Since my <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/starting-a-continuous-delivery-project" title="Starting a Continuous Delivery Project">original post</a> I have setup a dedicated Hyper-V server on Windows 2012 RC and moved the original AVL-BUILD-01 and AVL-BETA-01 server to this host, adding an AVL-SQL-01 that serves as a host for environment-specific MSSQL databases. I created the new TeamCity build server (AVL-BUILD-02) to match the original, including same versions of OS, Visual Studio, etc:</p>
<p><b>Initial Installs:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 2008 R2 + lots of Windows updates</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 + more updates (SP1, etc)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3" title="ASP.Net MVC 3 Download" target="_blank">ASP.Net MVC3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/" title="TeamCity download" target="_blank">TeamCity 7.1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/" title="Mercurial download" target="_blank">Mercurial 2.3.0</a> (only version difference from AVL-BUILD-01)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.iis.net/learn/install/installing-publishing-technologies/installing-and-configuring-web-deploy" title="Installing Web Deploy on iis.net" target="_blank">Web Deploy 2.1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2007/05/wcat-63-%28x64%29" title="WCAT 6.3 download on iis.net" target="_blank">WCAT 6.3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Firefox download" target="_blank">FireFox 146 (or whatever)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As noted, the Firefox and mercurial installs didn&#8217;t match, version-wise, but everything else I kept the same as the Jenkins build server.</p>
<h2>Creating the CI Build</h2>
<p>The CI project is probably the most complex one due to the number of steps and fact that it serves the artifacts every later step will use. </p>
<p><b>1: Create the project</b><br />
The project serves as the container for the builds, creating one only requires a name and optional description:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_01.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_01_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Project Setup" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Project Setup
</div>
<p>Once the project is named, I can add my first build step (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll only do these screen shots one time):</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_02.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_02_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Ready to add builds" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Ready to add builds
</div>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll name the build step and define the artifacts I want to store for later use, including the deployment package I intend to make and the folder of environment-specific configurations.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_03.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_03_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Adding a Build" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Adding a Build
</div>
<p>Next is the settings for the main site code repository. To create VCS settings for the build we need to create the VCS root (which includes the polling settings) then define the settings that are specific to this build. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_04.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_04_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Defining Version Control" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Defining Version Control
</div>
<p>At this point I can start adding my build steps. These build steps will duplicate the ones I used in Jenkins. An advantage over the Jenkins setup is that the MSBuild runner already has versions configured and there is a built-in MSTest runner. When entering the command-line calls I used in Jenkins, I&#8217;ll substitute in TeamCity variables using the small <img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCityPopup.gif" alt="Popup icon" /> image next to the inputs.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_05.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_05_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Build Steps" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Build Steps
</div>
<p>Below the build steps I have used the report processing feature to process the results of the smoke test script (<a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-project-deploy-and" title="Continuous Delivery Project - Deploy and Smoke Test">original post here</a>), which outputs in JUnit format. TeamCity will automatically collect the results from the MSTest step and this step and make them available in the summary and run details.</p>
<p>The second to last steps is to setup a build trigger to run on VCS changes, which is a couple clicks and extremely straightforward.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_06.png" alt="TeamCity - Adding a Trigger" /><br />
	Team City &#8211; Adding a Trigger
</div>
<p>Then the last step is to define the build parameters. TeamCity automatically detected the extra unrecognized parameters from my command-line build steps and has added them to the list of build configurations, which I thought was pretty slick. To make it even better, I can reference these parameters from later builds to reduce the number of places I need to define unique settings.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_07.png" alt="TeamCity - Build Parameters" /><br />
	Team City &#8211; Build Parameters
</div>
<p>Once I have finished setting up this build, I can return to the main dashboard and run it on demand by pressing the &#8220;Run&#8221; button.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_08.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_08_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Dashboard" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Dashboard
</div>
<p>And we have the first build stage done.</p>
<h2>Creating the Interface Testing Build</h2>
<p>The interface testing build (<a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-adding-an-automated" title="
Continuous Delivery - Adding an Automated Interface Test Stage">original post here</a>) is only a few steps. The first few stages of this build are the same, I create the build, define a VCS root that points to the Interface testing project on BitBucket, then add the build steps. I use an MSBuild step to build the automated interface test project (SpecFlow, Nunit, Selenium), command-line steps to call MSDeploy and the smoke test script, copy in the automated test settings for the tests, then use the built-in Nunit test runner to run the automated test assembly.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_09.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_09_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Interface Test Build" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Interface Test Build
</div>
<p>Skipping ahead to the Dependencies section, I&#8217;ll add a snapshot dependency on the CI stage so that builds of the Interface stage use snapshots from the same point in time as it&#8217;s linked CI build. I&#8217;ll also add an artifact dependency to pull all of the artifacts from the CI build into a local folder named PriorArtifacts, keeping with the pattern I used in the Jenkins build. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_10.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_10_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Dependencies" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Dependencies
</div>
<p>Next I add a build trigger to run after a successful build of the CI stage and fill the dependencies with references to the values from the CI Build where I can.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_11.png" alt="TeamCity - Build Parameters" /><br />
	Team City &#8211; Build Parameters
</div>
<p>And the last step is to return to the project screen and define the Artifacts for this stage as &#8220;PriorArtifacts/*&#8221; so it will pass on all of the artifacts it pulled in from the prior stage.</p>
<p>Running this build reminded me that Firefox has a nasty habit of downloading updates when you least want them, as the interface tests started timing out because they couldn&#8217;t quit. A quick tweak to the Firefox settings and I have a successful interface test step running, with the test results showing in the summary just like the CI stage.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_12.png" alt="TeamCity - Interface Tests" /><br />
	Team City &#8211; Interface Tests
</div>
<p>Note: The build number for each build allows you to define your own pattern. By setting it to %dep.bt2.build.number%, each of my builds use the build number I created in the CI stage (which is used again in the smoke tests).</p>
<h2>Creating the Load Test, QA, and Prod Builds</h2>
<p>At this point I have all the pieces I need to finish out the last 3 stages.</p>
<p><b>Load Test Build</b><br />
The Load Test stage (<a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-adding-the-load" title="Continuous Delivery - Load Test Stage">see original here</a>) gets the same build number and artifacts as the Interface Testing stage. I add a new VCS root to pull down the load tests scripts from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.loadtest" title="My load test repository on bitbucket">BitBucket</a>, deploy, smoke test, then run the run.cmd file that runs the WCAT load test. I skipped the challenging part of this, which is turning the results into a chart, but as I mentioned earlier that sounds like it will be a follow-up post of it&#8217;s own. The dependencies, parameters, and build trigger are set up the same as the Interface testing build.</p>
<p><b>Deploy QA and Deploy Prod Builds</b><br />
The last two are rinse and repeats. Take the build number and artifact settings, no VCS settings, add dependencies and leave them to be triggered manually.</p>
<h2>The Pipeline</h2>
<p>Those 5 builds compromise the core of the pipeline and show up in the TeamCity dashboard like so:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_13.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_13_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Full Dashboard" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Full Dashboard
</div>
<p>To get to the build chains view, go into the Project page and click the last tab to the right, titled &#8220;Build Chains&#8221;.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_14.png" target="_blank"><br />
		<img style="border: 1px solid #999999" src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/TeamCity_14_sm.png" alt="TeamCity - Build Chains" /><br />
	</a><br />
	Team City &#8211; Build Chains
</div>
<p>The summary bar lists the final step and status in the chain, the last step that ran, and the date. Expanding it shows the full chain (though there are some scrolling issues).</p>
<h2>Last Words</h2>
<p>This was an interesting project, as I was able to take a fairly complex build and see how it would work in a completely different engine. The addition of a first class pipeline view is probably the biggest item on my wishlist and I look forward to seeing what they do with it in the future. Even without that, though, it was a great tool to use and offered me none of the teething problems I had with several of the Jenkins plugins.</p>

<p><i>Note: I wasn&#8217;t purposefully performance tuning my sample site. This move was a necessary step to prep for doing some other SQL Server related things with the project and the performance improvement was just a neat side effect.</i></p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>The graph below shows the results of the load test stage of my build over several builds. </p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/SqlServerLoadTestRates.png" alt="Graph of Requests/Second and Transactions/Second" /></p>
<p>We start with the Rate graph. On the left we see a rate of about 30 requests/second from when the system was still on the SQL Server CE file and the build and beta VMs resided on their original home (i7 920, VMWare, using Hyper-V equivalent of 2 logical CPUs). In the middle we have the move to their new home (i7 3770K, Hyper-V 2012) still on the SQL Server CE file and switching from one to two virtual CPUs assigned to the beta web server. The last third is the results of moving the primary database to a SQL Server VM, which improved the performance by roughly 3x and appears to have found a new performance constraint.</p>
<p>The transaction rate has gone from about 1.8 to about 4.8 per second.</p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/SqlServerLoadTestResponses.png" alt="Graph of time to last response for minimum, average, 95%, 99%, and maximum" /></p>
<p>We can see the response times have been fairly stable, up to the 99% mark, with the max being a little wonky. The 95% and average marks have gone from averaging 650ms and 250ms on the original server with CE to 450ms and 80ms respectively on SQL Server.</p>
<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>The data for these results are generated automatically as part of the <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli%27s_Continuous_Delivery_Project" title="See more information in the Continuous Delivery wiki entry">build process</a> for my application. I have 3 dedicated VMs for the build server, a web server, and a database server and they are all currently housed on a 2012 Hyper-V server. Each is assigned about 2GB of RAM and 2, 1, 1 CPUs for the web, build, and DB server respectively. The host has nothing else running on it and is an i7 3770K w/ 16GB of high speed RAM behind it and mirrored standard drives on SATA III.</p>
<p>The data was collected as part of the <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-adding-the-load" title="Implementing the Automated Load test blog post">automated Load Test</a> step of the build process. During this step, the build server deploys a copy of the application to a website on the web VM and then spins up WCAT to <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/implementing-wcat-for-load-testing" title="Implementing WCAT to test a website">load test the site</a>. There is an incremental spin up period that warms up the site and connection pool, followed by a 2.5 minute sustained test where WCAT runs as fast as it can against the site. </p>
<p>The load test is a full transaction that makes the same requests a real world browser makes as it selects an album, adds it to a cart, and then checks out, including static content and dynamic content. Each transaction is in a unique session and reports the appropriate headers with each HTTP request. The increase from 1.8 to 4.8 transactions per second can be restated as an increase from 1.8 to 4.8 individual purchases per second.</p>
<p>The site is still on SQL CE for the membership database, which is used during the checkout, and it is using Entity Framework 4 for data access to SQL Server (so more headroom for improvement if I was actually tuning for performance).</p>
<p>After seeing the increase I thought it would be interesting to share the numbers as well as how useful it is to have a short load test as part of the delivery pipeline.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running static analysis checks can help keep us on track with our standards, identify unused code, identify similar code blocks, and much more. In a manual process, running these tools can be time consuming, costing time to wait for the run complete, more time if we don&#8217;t abandon them after the first run and have to maintain a schedule, and even more time if someone has to keep a spreadsheet somewhere to compare the results from run to run. Add an automated build process, and we can net the same level of information and trending for a modest setup cost.</p>
<p>Up until now, all of the additions to my <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli%27s_Continuous_Delivery_Project" title="Wiki page on Eli's Continuous Delivery project">Continuous Delivery project</a> have been focused on building, testing, and deploying the code. In this post we&#8217;ll discuss the potential benefits and costs of adding static analysis to the pipeline and then walk through the details of adding several of those checks into the sample project.</p>
<p><i>Note: The components outlined in this post have actually been part of the continuous delivery pipeline for a few months, driving changes and cleanup commits from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.main/changeset/b81657c2f260" title="First style clean-up commit">December 21st</a> forward as I continued to build out some of the later components.</i></p>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>Even with automation, there is still a cost to static analysis. These tools take time and resources to run. The larger our codebase gets, the more time and memory the tools will require to analyze the code and generate results. We have two dials we can use to help reduce the impact on our end-to-end delivery time: tool selection and process location.</p>
<p>The importance and usefulness of the data should drive which tools we use and where we configure them to run. The goal is to limit the impact on delivery time while selecting the right tools for our projects and development style. If we intend to use the data for standards enforcement or as process constraints then it is going to be more effective as part of the pipeline, but if it is for informational purposes then a parallel step or separate, scheduled build may be more appropriate. Altering the location can be used to run tasks as part of the primary build chain*, in parallel to the main build chain, or even in a separate build, each with higher or lower impact to that end-to-end delivery time.</p>
<p><i>* Note: If you map out your build process along with the amount of time it takes for each step and the amount of time that is spent waiting in between steps, you can total the numbers to calculate a total delivery time for defect-free commits. This is helpful when evaluating the costs of adding an additional sequential step, parallel step, or none at all.</i></p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Static analysis tools provide visibility into the style and structure of our code. There are tools to help capture TODO comments we&#8217;ve left in the code, tools to analyze the level of copy and paste, code coverage, even tools that offer so many measures they incorporate query engines (like <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/" title="NDepend Homepage">NDepend</a>). The ability to run them regularly without the ongoing cost is great, but by running them as part of our builds we also gain the ability to apply the results to the build quality, potentially failing the build if the code exhibits too much of a bad behavior. </p>
<p>When they&#8217;re used correctly, the ability to affect the build quality brings the greatest benefit. Failing the build when the code doesn&#8217;t meet our quality forces us to address the issues immediately. The changes we committed are still fresh in our minds, making this is the fastest (and cheapest) point in time we could clean them up. </p>
<p>To support this, we&#8217;re forced to define our standards for code quality. When a build fails, we are then making a correction to meet our guaranteed standards, which is easier for our company or project manager to accept than if we had taken it upon ourselves to clean up some code in the middle of a crunch. </p>
<p>Lastly, it helps prevent us from putting those fixes off and building up a mountain of technical debt that tends to bog down execution on so many projects. We are keeping the code more consistent and doing so at the cheapest time possible.</p>
<h2>Choosing Some Tools</h2>
<p>So there are some costs and some benefits, but what does it look like when these tools are wired in and running as part of the build? Let&#8217;s add them and find out.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the sample Continuous Delivery project, I am going to be adding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiler Warnings &#8211; Scanning for compiler warnings in the output is the cheap and easy to clean up</li>
<li>Open Tasks &#8211; Scanning for HACK, TODO, and REFACTOR tags in the source code</li>
<li>Duplicate Code &#8211; Scanning for duplicate code blocks that could be refactored</li>
<li>Rule Based Scanning &#8211; Scanning for situations that violate a set of style rules</li>
<li>Code Coverage &#8211; Evaluate the test coverage levels on our code to identify areas with low coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>As we go through each one, I&#8217;ll identify the external tool and/or Jenkins plugins.</p>
<h3>Static Analysis Trends</h3>
<p>Several of the plugins below produce data that can be captured and displayed on the job summary screen as trends. They require the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Analysis+Collector+Plugin" title="Jenkins Analysis Collector Plugin">Analysis Collector Plugin</a> as a prerequisite. There are no setup steps to this core plugin, so after installing it we can continue on to the real work below.</p>
<h3>Compiler Warnings</h3>
<p>Compiler warnings can be captured easily using the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Plugin" title="Jenkins Warnings Plugin">Warnings Plugin</a>. After adding it to the Jenkins server, we can open the CI job and add the checks in the &#8220;post-build Actions&#8221; section:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Warnings.png" title="Analysis - Compiler Warnings" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Compiler Warnings
</div>
<p>The plugin has the ability to scan the build output and files in our workspace, with parsers for a number of different tools. In this case I&#8217;ve chosen to capture the MSBuild output, but I could just as easily capture output from something like JSLint (speaking of future projects). A trend of the warning count is added to the job summary screen and a summary of the warnings is displayed on each individual run:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Warnings_Summary.png" title="Analysis - Compiler Warnings Summary" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Compiler Warnings Summary
</div>
<p>And drilling in we can see the details:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Warnings_Detail.png" title="Analysis - Compiler Warnings Details" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Compiler Warnings Details
</div>
<p>In this case, we&#8217;re actually looking at the warnings from 49 builds ago. Since the results are incorporated into the build summary, I can access past versions for as long as I keep the job history.</p>
<h3>Open Tasks</h3>
<p>Open tasks refer to those little TODO and HACK tags we litter throughout our code, always with the intent of someday coming back and doing something with them. Using the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Task+Scanner+Plugin" title="Jenkins Task Scanner plugin">Task Scanner Plugin</a>, the build can scan the code and add these comments to the trends and build details.</p>
<p>The plugin adds a section to the &#8220;post-build Actions&#8221; section, which we can then configure to fit our specific needs:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Tasks.png" title="Analysis - Open Tasks" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Open Tasks
</div>
<p>In the job, we can specify which tags to capture from the code and the filename pattern to use for code files. There is also an advanced section where we can add thresholds. For instance, this is where I could define that 20 or more cases of the high priority tag should cause the build to fail until we get our HACK&#8217;s back under control.</p>
<p>The output for this plugin is similar to the Compiler Warnings, with a trend on the main project page, a summary in the individual job:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Tasks_Summary.png" title="Analysis - Open Tasks Summary" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Open Tasks Summary
</div>
<p>And a details page we can drill into:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Tasks_Details.png" title="Analysis - Open Tasks Details" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Open Tasks Details
</div>
<p>The scan pulls out not just the presence of these tags, but also the content and location of the messages. This makes it easy to quickly scan them and pick one to try and knock off the list.</p>
<h3>Duplicate Code</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code" title="Code duplication on Wikipedia">Code duplication</a> is a code smell that adds a number of risks to your codebase, violating the DRY (<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html" title="Don't Repeat Yourself - heh">Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself</a>) principle.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools out there to detect duplication in code, in this case I chose to use <a href="http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/" title="Simian homepage">Simian</a> and import and display the results via the  <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations" title="Violations Plugin">Violations Plugin</a>, which is also used below for analyzing the code against common problems and style rules.</p>
<p>First, we need to run simian against our codebase to produce a report. I&#8217;ve added a windows batch command as part of the build steps to run this command, placing it after the unit tests but before the test deployment. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Simian_Command.png" title="Analysis - Simian Execution" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Simian Execution
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve told Simian to run against all *.cs files in my project directory, excluding the sample data file that is used to generate a sample Entity Framework model. At the tail end I force it to return an exit code of 0 so the job will continue to run the later steps and post-build analysis. Simian will helpfully return a failure exit code when it finds violations, but that&#8217;s not useful for this case.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;post-build Action&#8221; section, I&#8217;ve provided the path to the output file Simian creates:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Simian_PostBuild.png" title="Analysis - Simian - Post Build" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Simian &#8211; Post Build
</div>
<p>We also have the ability to define thresholds for good, stormy, and unstable, based on the number of duplicate blocks found.</p>
<p>In the summary screen for the job and each individual run screen, the DRY plugin will add a trend that displays the number of duplicate blocks found over time.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Simian_Summary.png" title="Analysis - Simian - Summary Trend" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Simian &#8211; Summary Trend
</div>
<p>As we drill into the details, we get a list of the files where duplicates occur, and can then drill down into those to see the actual code that was found.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Simian_Details.png" title="Analysis - Simian - Detail Trend" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Simian &#8211; Detail Trend
</div>
<p>In this case it has found an interface and an implementation of that interface that have a block of 11 lines of code in common.</p>
<h3>Code Standards</h3>
<p>When it comes to code standards, the two main engines I had to choose from were <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme" title="Gendarme at Mono Project">Gendarme</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop" title="Wikipedia page for FxCop">FxCop</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations" title="Violations Plugin">Violations Plugin</a> can handle either, so I opted for Gendarme (I believe it was faster for my specific scenario).</p>
<p>Like Simian above, I need to first run the executable against the codebase, then consume the generated report post-build to feed the trends and details.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Gendarme_Command.png" title="Analysis - Gendarme - Batch Command" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Gendarme &#8211; Batch Command
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve added the command for Gendarme after the unit tests and before the Simian command above, pointing it at the dll for the project and specifying I want XML output. As with Simian, I&#8217;ve forced the batch to return an exit code of 0 so the run will continue through to process the later steps.</p>
<p>also like simian, we specify the location of the XML file in the Violations section of the &#8220;post-Build Actions&#8221;.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Simian_PostBuild.png" title="Analysis - Gendarme - Post Build" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Gendarme &#8211; Post Build
</div>
<p>The Violations plugin overlays the Gendarme results on the chart we saw above:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Simian_Summary.png" title="Analysis - Gendarme - Summary Trend" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Gendarme &#8211; Summary Trend
</div>
<p>And the detail results are also very similar:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Gendarme_Details.png" title="Analysis - Gendarme - Detail Trend" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Gendarme &#8211; Detail Trend
</div>
<p>However once we drill in, we not only get the code view but also can hover over the identified warning locations for details on the rule the gendarme is reporting on.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Analysis_Gendarme_Details2.png" title="Analysis - Gendarme - Code Details" /><br />
	Analysis &#8211; Gendarme &#8211; Code Details
</div>
<p>The early downward trend above corresponds to the commits starting on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.main/changeset/b81657c2f260" title="First style clean-up commit">December 21st</a>, when I started cleaning up some of the worst offenders.</p>
<h3>Code Coverage</h3>
<p>Code coverage identifies the level of test coverage in our codebase by monitoring the tests as they run against our assemblies. For this step I used <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover" title="OpenCover on Github">OpenCover</a> combined with <a href="http://reportgenerator.codeplex.com/" title="ReportGenerator on COdeplex">ReportGenerator</a> to convert the output into an HTML report, and the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin" title="HTML Publisher Plugin">HTML Publisher Plugin</a> to incorporate the generated reports into the job results.</p>
<p>This one took more steps for setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download or clone the OpenCover source from Github</li>
<li>Build using the included Build.bat script</li>
<li>Copy the compiled binary to my build server</li>
<li>Copy the ReportGenerator folder to server</li>
<li>Replace existing MS Test batch command with call to run it from OpenCover and process results with ReportGenerator (below)</li>
</ul>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="text"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">Text</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1

<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">mkdir "%WORKSPACE%testresults"
"C:AdditionalScriptsOpenCoverOpenCover.Console.exe" -target:"C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7IDEmstest.exe"  -targetargs:"/resultsfile:"%WORKSPACE%testresultsMyTests.Results.xml" /testcontainer:"%WORKSPACE%MvcMusicStoreTestsbinReleaseMvcMusicStoreTests.dll" /nologo"  -mergebyhash -filter:"+[MvcM*]*" -output:"%WORKSPACE%testresultsopencovertests.xml"

"C:AdditionalScriptsReportGeneratorReportGenerator.exe" "%WORKSPACE%testresultsopencovertests.xml" "%WORKSPACE%testresultshtml" Html</pre></div></div>

<p>This command (1) creates the test results folder, (2) runs OpenCover with arguments to locate the MSTest executable, flags to use with MSTest, a filter to limit execution to the main assemblies, and an output filename. The last lines (3) run the ReportGenerator executable against the results, producing the HtmlSummary report and (4) detailed HTML reports for each file. </p>
<p>Checking the &#8220;Publish HTML reports&#8221; option in &#8220;post-build Actions&#8221;, we can specify the folder, index page, and title to use for the generated reports.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">

	Analysis &#8211; Coverage &#8211; PostBuild
</div>
<p>This adds a sidebar link to the job summary, which links to the summary we generated and the detail pages associated with it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">

	Analysis &#8211; Coverage Summary Report
</div>
<p>Each of the links has a details report behind it that includes code statistics, like cyclomatic complexity, and a copy of the code with markers to indicate covered vs uncovered lines.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The addition of these tools to my project was done as part of the CI build, placing them sequentially into the process. This works with a smaller project but needs to be evaluated more carefully in a larger project.</p>
<p>The results from these tests have helped me clean my code up, identify gaps in the test coverage when I accidentally created them, and given me a good amount of historical knowledge about the quality of the code itself. The setup time was not that expensive and I can continue to take advantage of the benefits in every future build I do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adding load testing to my continuous build process provides several benefits for a fairly cheap entry fee. As the development process progresses, I&#8217;ll have a baseline and know if I add something to the application that impacts the performance. I&#8217;ll also be able to accurately discuss it&#8217;s performance when asked, instead of guessing. And if I want to increase the performance, that same baseline will serve as a guide on my progress. </p>
<p>Not every application needs to process 100,000 transactions/second, but the cost of guessing how well our application will perform tends to catch up with us.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/implementing-wcat-for-load-testing" title="Using WCAT to Load Test">previous post</a>, I walked through using WCAT to  define and execute a load test scenario against the site from my <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli%27s_Continuous_Delivery_Project" title="Continuous Delivery Wiki page">continuous delivery project</a>. In this post, I&#8217;ll take those WCAT scripts and incorporate them into Jenkins as a new build step in my delivery pipeline, not only running the load test but capturing the results so I can show them over time.</p>
<h2>Prep the Server</h2>
<p>Before I can start configuring my new build step, I need to prep the server. Following the steps in my prior post, I&#8217;ll download the WCAT msi to the build server and install it, then register the build server as a WCAT client:</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="text"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">Text</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1

</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1">cscript //H:cscript
wcat.wsf –terminate –update –clients localhost</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">cscript //H:cscript
wcat.wsf –terminate –update –clients localhost</pre></div></div>

<p>And, of course, wait for the obligatory reboot to go through.</p>
<h2>Creating the Build Job</h2>
<p>Initially I want a build job that I can run manually, to let me tweak the test execution, results capture, and plotting. The overall plan for the job will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the load test scripts from a dedicated source repository</li>
<li>Pull in the compiled artifacts from the first step (continuous integration)</li>
<li>Deploy the artifacts to a remote IIS web application folder</li>
<li>Smoke test the deployment</li>
<li>Run the Load Test against the delpoyed application</li>
<li>Capture the results of the Smoke Test and Load Test</li>
</ul>
<p><i>While I originally expected the load test portion to be the trickiest, the reality was that plotting the results ended up being the hardest part of the whole adventure.</i></p>
<p>First up is defining the parameter for the CI build number:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config1.png" title="Load Test Job - Build Parameter" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Build Parameter
</div>
<p>Then I need to add in the code repository that I&#8217;m hosting the Load Test scripts from the last post in:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config2.png" title="Load Test Job - Load Test Scripts" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Load Test Scripts
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Envfile+Plugin" title="Jenkins EnvFile Plugin">EnvFile plugin</a> to allow me to store critical information, like server names and passwords, in an external settings file:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config3.png" title="Load Test Job - External Settings" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; External Settings
</div>
<p>Then using the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Copy+Artifact+Plugin" title="Jenkins Copy Artifact Plugin">Copy Artifact</a> plugin, I&#8217;ll add a build step to retrieve the zipped deployable website from the CI build step:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config4.png" title="Load Test Job - Copy Artifacts" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Copy Artifacts
</div>
<p>With those retrieved, I can now deploy them to my remote server using MS Deploy and execute the VBScript file I created to smoke test the deployed site, each as windows batch command steps:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config4c.png" title="Load Test Job - Deploy + Smoke Test" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Deploy + Smoke Test
</div>
<p><i>Note: These commands and scripts are available in the <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-project-deploy-and" title="Continuous Delivery - Deploy and Smoke Test">Deploy and Smoke Test post</a></i></p>
<p>The actual command to execute the load test is nicely wrapped in a the Run.cmd file, so I can add a batch command to execute that:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config4b.png" title="Load Test Job - Run Load Test" /><br />
	I only included this screenshot to be consistent with the rest of the steps <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</div>
<p>The last steps archive the log.xml file that WCAT produces, </p>

	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config5.png" title="Load Test Job - Archive Log File" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Archive Log File
</div>
<p>capture the results of the smoke test, </p>

<p>and clutter up my twitter feed. </p>

	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config7.png" title="Load Test Job - Twitter Checkbox" /><br />
	Twitter Checkbox
</div>
<p>With that I have a fully functional build job that deploys a website on demand and load tests it. </p>
<p>And now the really hard part. Doing something with the load test results (you think I&#8217;m being sarcastic, but just wait).</p>
<h2>Displaying the Results</h2>
<p>This was an interesting project and, oddly enough, went like so many IT projects do. We get 90% of the way done and then find out we have another 180% to do.</p>
<p>There is really only one plugin in Jenkins that I could find to handle plotting for free form data. I did look into trying to misuse the JMeter plugin (like I repurpose the JUnit one to capture my smoke test results), but at a glance it looked like JMeter provide the detailed data without the summaries, while WCAT is just giving me the summaries. </p>
<h3>The Plot Plugin (Duh Duh Duuuuh)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plot+Plugin" title="Jenkins Plot Plugin">Plot Plugin</a> is finicky, poorly documented, and has some hinkiness in the Jenkins display that I haven&#8217;t seen from other plugins. It annoyed me enough that I actually started reading through the source code in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/plot-plugin" title="Jenkins Plot Plugin on GitHub">github</a> to get help figuring out some of it&#8217;s behavior (and then after seeing it, briefly considered trying to relearn java long enough to add some much needed fixes). </p>
<p>Among it&#8217;s other weaknesses, the plot plugin doesn&#8217;t allow you to set data labels, it automatically uses the tag names of the XML. Which doesn&#8217;t work so well when your XML nodes all have the same name. </p>
<p>Like the WCAT results.</p>
<p>Argh.</p>
<p>So after much wrestling, I decided to map the WCAT data to a new XML file purely for the purposes of feeding the plot plugin (and to also reconfigure it so I could enter all the points for a plot from one XPath query, don&#8217;t get me started on forcing me to re-enter the filename for each XPath statement for the same plot).</p>

<p>The last piece of the equation is to configure the Plot in the load test job. Here is an example of one graph configuration (the full set is pretty long):</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/LoadTest_Config8.png" title="Load Test Job - Plot Settings" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Plot Settings
</div>
<p>Each plot has an XPath statement that corresponds to one of the sections of the result XML file, that way I have unique names for the values when it stores the data and I have labels on the plots. Running the job a few times to build up data and my  graph looks like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/load_diagram.png" title="Load Test Job - Response Time Diagram" /><br />
	Load Test Job &#8211; Response Time Diagram
</div>
<p><i>Note: I suspect the fact that I got bored and was watching Netflix for the last few tests had some effect on the values</i></p>
<p>And there we go, I now have a job that I can run on demand that will load test my site.</p>
<h2>Incorporate into Build Pipeline</h2>
<p>The last step of this whole load test adventure is incorporating the load test job I&#8217;ve created into my build pipeline. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_load.png" title="Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Load Test Step" /><br />
	Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Load Test Step
</div>
<p>The only changes necessary to insert the Load Test job into the pipeline is to modify my &#8220;ASPNet MVC Music Store Interface Tests&#8221; build job to trigger a parametrized build of this new load test and in the load test, check the &#8220;Build Pipeline Plugin -> Manually Execute Downstream Project&#8221; option and specify the &#8220;Deploy to QA&#8221; build step as the target. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_wload.png" title="Continuous Delivery Pipeline w/ Load Testing Step" /><br />
	Continuous Delivery Pipeline w/ Load Testing Step
</div>
<p>With the steps rewired, the pipeline now incorporates the Load Testing job.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>While the plotting portion of this project took longer than I expected, I still managed to do the whole thing in under 8 hours, and that includes writing part of the first blog and the fact that I was working on it in pieces, in between sleeping, feeding the baby, and so on. </p>
<p>Not every project needs to be the fastest, most responsive application on the planet, but given how cheaply you can add some basic numbers into your process, the net gain of knowing exactly how your application is performing and the heads up when you do something that really breaks performance are both valuable and fairly inexpensive to implement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Automating the deployment of software to the various test, QA, and Production environments streamlines the software delivery process, provides a well-practiced routine prior to the production deployment, and removes a lot of the risks that come with depending on people&#8217;s memories and checklists in order to get a working production push. Automating the deployment also makes the process more repeatable and less prone to error, simplifying the creation or recreation of an environment not just for the current release, but for past releases as well.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">

	Delivery Pipeline &#8211; Focus of Current Post
</div>
<p>This is the final post in a multi-part series on my Continuous Delivery pipeline project. The <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-adding-an-automated" title="Adding an Automated Interface Testing stage">previous post</a> followed the implementation of the automated interface stage, the second job in my chain of automated jobs. The last steps in my pipeline will be push button deployments to my QA and production environments. While I don&#8217;t have a true QA process and the production environment is simply a subfolder <a href="http://tiernok.com/MVCMusicStore/" title="MVCMusicStore on my personal site">on my personal site</a>, I wanted to include these two steps because they will be common to most real pipelines.</p>
<h2>The Dashboard</h2>
<p>Early on in the project I found a &#8220;Build Pipeline&#8221; plugin for Jenkins and started looking into it. Before finding this, I was expecting I would have to write my own dashboard for visualization and triggering manual deployments. Luckily <a href="http://www.centrumsystems.com.au/" title="Centrum Systems">Centrum Systems</a> has already done the hard work for us in creating and making available the &#8220;Build Pipeline&#8221; plugin.</p>
<p>As with other plugins, the &#8220;Build Pipeline&#8221; plugin is available through the &#8220;Available Plugins&#8221; menu in Jenkins. This plugin is what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;View&#8221; plugin. It allows us to generate a new view of the build data on our dashboard, then layers additional functionality and available configuration values into the jobs.</p>
<p>The configuration instructions on <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin" title="Build Pipeline Plugin page">the Build Pipeline Plugin page</a> provide all the information that is necessary to get started.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_setup1.png" title="Build Pipeline Plugin - Setup" /><br />
	Build Pipeline Plugin &#8211; Setup
</div>
<p>In the initial setup I have provided a name and title and, most importantly, selected the CI Build job as my pipeline starting point. Pressing Ok, the plugin looks at my build and will generate the pipeline starting at that selected project and tracing it forward through build triggers to any additional projects. In my case, I only have the CI build and the interface test job, so I get a pipeline with just two steps.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_2step_lg.png" title="Larger view" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_2step.png" title="Pipeline Dashboard - CI and Interface Tests" /></a><br />
	Pipeline Dashboard &#8211; CI and Interface Tests
</div>
<p>The pipeline dashboard shows me the two steps (left to right) of my current pipeline and the trigger on the left side (either the Hg revision number or &#8220;No revision&#8221; for manual builds). Inside each tile is the name of the job, date, and duration. Each tile also links to the details for the specific run.</p>
<h3>Manually Execute Downstream Jobs</h3>
<p>With the addition of the pipeline plugin, there is a new option available in the Post-build section to define downstream projects to be manually triggered.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_newtrigger.png" title="Interface Job - Manual Trigger for QA Deployment" /><br />
	Interface Job &#8211; Manual Trigger for QA Deployment
</div>
<p>When the next step in a build chain is triggered by this type of build trigger instead of the normal trigger or parametrized trigger I added in the previous post, it is displayed in the pipeline dashboard with a button.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_deploybutton.png" title="Pipeline Dashboard - Manual Trigger Button" /><br />
	Pipeline Dashboard &#8211; Manual Trigger Button
</div>
<p>These are perfect for our QA and production steps, as the build chain will execute up until this point and then wait for a human to make the decision to update the QA or production environment. When I push the button, the information is still available from the previous portion of the build chain, including environment variables (like the SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER) that were set in the beginning. </p>
<p><i>Note: There is currently a bug in the Pipeline plugin where the value for a parametrized build is overwritten by it&#8217;s default value when you retry a build. This means that currently if an Interface Tests job fails, retrying will retry for SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER=0 instead of the proper value from it&#8217;s previous step, which will fail. The value still works fine for the later steps, as there isn&#8217;t a default to override it.</i></p>
<p>Now all I need is a QA and Production step.</p>
<h2>QA and Production Deployment</h2>
<p>The QA and Production deployment steps are going to be very nearly the same. Both will be responsible for getting the artifacts that were generated in the first step of the build chain, deploying those artifacts to the appropriate server, and then running the smoke tests to verify the deployment was executed successfully. These are all steps I have done in prior jobs, so this may actually be as easy as I expect it to be.</p>
<h3>Creating the Deployment Jobs</h3>
<p>To start with I create the empty &#8220;ASPNet MVC Music Store Deploy to QA&#8221; and &#8220;ASPNet MVC Music Store Deploy to Production&#8221; jobs in Jenkins. Returning to the Automated Interface job, I set the &#8220;Manually Execute Downstream Project&#8221; to my new QA job. In the QA job, I set the value to my Production job.</p>
<p>And I check twitter in both, because it&#8217;s fun to see all the tweets.</p>
<p>Now, either because the environment variables are passed from the first job to all subsequent jobs or because there&#8217;s some magic that happens when a build triggers a second one, I still have access to &#8220;SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER&#8221; with the CI job&#8217;s build number. This is good, because I can use almost exactly the same settings as the relevant steps in the Interface test job to build out these two new jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Batch Step to delete local files: del /s /q *</li>
<li>Copy Artifacts from another project, by number using SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER</li>
<li>Windows Batch Step to execute an msdeploy</li>
<li>VBScript call to run the smoke tests</li>
<li>Capture the test results in the post-build step</li>
</ul>
<p>The only difference between the QA and production version of these is the MSDeploy script and the URL for the smoke tests. </p>
<p><b>QA MS Deploy Command:</b><br />
<code class="codespan">"C:Program FilesIISMicrosoft Web Deploy V2\msdeploy.exe" -source:package='%WORKSPACE%PriorArtifactsMvcMusicStore.zip' -dest:auto,computerName='AVL-BETA-01',userName='AVL-BETA-01Administrator',password='MYPASSWORD',includeAcls='False' -verb:sync -disableLink:AppPoolExtension -disableLink:ContentExtension -disableLink:CertificateExtension -setParam:"IIS Web Application Name"="Default Web Site/MvcMusicStore_QA"</code></p>
<p>The production one, however, is deploying to a webhost and needs a different set of information in order to chat with my webhosts Management services.</p>
<p><b>Production MS Deploy Command:</b><br />
<code class="codespan">"C:Program FilesIISMicrosoft Web Deploy V2\msdeploy.exe" -source:package='%WORKSPACE%PriorArtifactsMvcMusicStore.zip' -dest:auto,computerName='https://DEPLOY_ADDRESS_PROVIDED_BY_HOST:8172/MsDeploy.axd?site=tiernok.com',userName='MY_USERNAME',password='MY_PASSWORD',includeAcls='False',authtype=basic -allowUntrusted  -verb:sync -disableLink:AppPoolExtension -disableLink:ContentExtension -disableLink:CertificateExtension -setParam:"IIS Web Application Name"="tiernok.com/MvcMusicStore" -enableRule:DoNotDeleteRule </code></p>
<p>Because these jobs both rely on their upstream jobs to provide the necessary information, I can&#8217;t test them manually until I have the whole pipeline together. However, the only new part of this is the msdeploy command, which I can run manually from the command line to verify it&#8217;s working (or verify it&#8217;s broken, tweak it, run again, run again, run again, curse, get it right, paste it back into Jenkins).</p>
<h2>The Pipeline</h2>
<p>With the addition of &#8220;manually execute deployments&#8221; to the QA and Production environment, I&#8217;ve completed all the pieces I outlined in my original pipeline plan.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/Overview.png" title="Delivery Pipeline" /><br />
	Delivery Pipeline
</div>
<p>The dashboard in Jenkins has incorporated these two new jobs and now shows all 4 in each row, along with the buttons for QA and Prod deployments that haven&#8217;t run.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_done_lg.png" title="Larger view" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_done.png" title="Pipeline Dashboard - All Steps" /></a><br />
	Pipeline Dashboard &#8211; All Steps
</div>
<p>The individual tiles change color to indicate their status at a glance. As the build progresses, each step fires off a tweet to keep me up to date on what&#8217;s going on. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_inprogress.png" title="Larger view" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_inprogress.png" title="Pipeline Dashboard - In Progress" /></a><br />
	Pipeline Dashboard &#8211; In Progress
</div>
<p>And there we have it, my completed pipeline.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>With the pipeline done, I now have any number of next steps I could pursue. It&#8217;s bothered me that I took the easy way out on the database deployments, so I could return to add those in. I could also continue to extend the unit and interface tests, add static analysis of the code, even put in a step to verify that the HTML meets a published standard or that the page loads meet a minimum set of criteria. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting project, if a bit frustrating at times (thanks webdeploy). Feel free to follow up with me on the forums or in the comments below. If I do make additions to this later, I&#8217;ll list them in the <a href="http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Eli%27s_Continuous_Delivery_Project" title="Eli's COntinuous Deployment Project wiki entry">wiki post</a> for the project.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human beings are good at creative tasks. Put an end user in front of an interface and ask them to find an error and good luck stuffing that particular cat back into the bag. Where we don&#8217;t perform as well is performing those tasks repetitively. After several cycles we begin to lose focus, start listening more to our expectations than what we are actually seeing in front of us, gradually forget steps, or worse lose track and have to restart from the beginning. By automating the redundant tasks, we play to the strengths of the computer and free the human to return to creative duties.</p>

	Delivery Pipeline &#8211; Focus of Current Post
</div>
<p>This is the fifth post in a multi-part series on my Continuous Delivery pipeline project. The <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/continuous-delivery-project-deploy-and" title="Deploy and Smoke Test">previous post</a> completed the Continuous Integration job by performing a test deployment of the final package. In this post I&#8217;ll build the next stage in the pipeline, a job that is responsible for performing automated system testing against the website.</p>
<h2>The Interface Automation Stage</h2>
<p>In a production project this would probably be called Automated User Acceptance testing, but this project seems far too small to use that term and I don&#8217;t intend to automate enough user requirements. So I&#8217;ll refer to it as the Interface Automation Test project.</p>
<p>The Interface Automation stage will consist of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start when triggered by CI Build Job</li>
<li>Retrieve the automation project from it&#8217;s <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.interfacetests" title="MVCMusicStore.InterfaceTests on bitBucket">code repository</a></li>
<li>Retrieve the specific zip package the triggering CI build produced</li>
<li>Build the Automated test project</li>
<li>Deploy the site to a test site</li>
<li>Smoke test the deployment</li>
<li>Run the automated tests</li>
<li>Import the test results and finish</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the automated interface tests.</p>
<h2>MvcMusicStore.InterfaceTests</h2>
<p>The Interface tests project is a separate project and repository from the production site. Keeping this solution separate allows the CI build job to only be concerned with building the production code and unit tests and prevents the risk of cross-contamination between the production project and the automated interface project. </p>
<p>The project is available on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarwn/mvcmusicstore.interfacetests" title="MvcMusicStore.InterfaceTests on BitBucket">BitBucket</a>. I don&#8217;t intend to dive into the all of the details of building that project (and to be honest I didn&#8217;t build much in the way of test coverage), but feel free to follow up with me on the forums or in the comments below if you would like to discuss it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/interfacetests.png" title="Interface Tests Project" /><br />
	Interface Tests Project
</div>
<p>The project uses Selenium WebDriver to interface with the web browser by implementing the PageObject pattern (I covered this in a <a href="/index.php/WebDev/UIDevelopment/automated-web-testing-with-selenium-2" title="Automated Web Testing with Selenium WebDriver">previous Selenium post</a> if you would like to read more about the mechanics). Using this pattern I create a library of &#8220;Pages&#8221; that each correspond to a Page in my website.</p>
<p>With an abstracted library of &#8220;Pages&#8221;, I then use Nunit to write tests that follow a path of actions or pages through the site. For instance, a tour of the site looks like this:</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">

<p>Each page is aware of the shared top navigation links and implements methods to click those links and return the PageLibrary page that is associated with the real website page the link leads to. During navigation, the engine compares the expected page title in the object to the actual title in the browser to ensure we have loaded the page we were expecting. This allows me to treat each navigation as an implicit assertion as well, without having to specify it separately.</p>
<p>I use a TestFixtureBase class to manage the browser Driver instance and to load settings out of a local configuration file. This configuration file currently only lists the URL the site, but could also contain test usernames or data to use for a specific environment.</p>
<p>With a framework in place, it is easy to start expanding coverage.</p>

<p>Because I have used the Nunit framework, I can use any existing Nunit testrunner to run these tests, including the standard Nunit GUI or console executable.</p>
<h2>Creating the Build Job</h2>
<p>With a basic automated interface project built, I have enough of what I need to configure the new build job.</p>
<h3>Create the Job and Build</h3>
<p>Opening Jenkins in my browser, I create a New Job, selecting the freestyle project and specifying the name and a useful description. In the job configuration I go ahead and setup the mercurial repository information to pull down the Automated Interface test code. I then add steps to execute a build of the project and verify that the job works so far.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_stage2_build.png" title="Build Configuration" /><br />
	Interface Tests &#8211; Build Configuration
</div>
<p>To test the settings thus far, I&#8217;ll trigger a build manually and verify this portion of the project works. I&#8217;ll also go ahead and add <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/TarwnBuildSrvr" title="@TarwnBuildSrvr on Twitter">twitter</a> to my post-build steps again, just because.</p>
<h3>Import the CI Artifacts</h3>
<p>With the build step working, now I can focus on picking up the artifacts from the CI Build and getting them setup on a test site. From the plugins screen I install the &#8220;Copy Artifact&#8221; plugin, the &#8220;Trigger Parametrized Build&#8221; plugin, and the &#8220;Nunit&#8221; plugin. </p>
<p>In the top of my job configuration I&#8217;ll check the &#8220;This Build is Parametrized&#8221; box and add a SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER parameter where I will specify the CI Job&#8217;s build number that I want to run against. Initially this will require me to manually enter the build number, a bit later I&#8217;ll return to the CI Build and create a trigger to pass the parameter automatically.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_stage2_params.png" title="Build Parameters" /><br />
	Interface Tests &#8211; Build Parameters
</div>
<p>Next, I&#8217;ll add a &#8220;Copy artifacts from another project&#8221; step (Thank you &#8220;Copy Artifacts&#8221; plugin) to the top of the build steps. This plugin has a number of different options, but I&#8217;ll use the build number I passed in as a parameter to retrieve the artifacts. Using the parametrized number option allows me to run the job by typing a build number in, which can be handy, and is similar to how the later QA and Production deploy stages will be setup to retrieve artifacts (I like consistency).</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_stage2_artifacts.png" title="Copy Artifacts" /><br />
	Interface Tests &#8211; Copy Artifacts
</div>
<p>At this point I realized I had forgotten to check the &#8220;Clean Build&#8221; option in my Mercurial settings, so I&#8217;ll go back and add that so I don&#8217;t risk having a stale copy of the artifacts from a prior run.</p>
<h3>Deploy and Smoke Test</h3>
<p>Now that I have all the pieces in place, it&#8217;s just a matter of putting them together. Like the CI Build Job, I&#8217;ll create a Deploy batch command and a Smoke Test batch command. The only difference is that here I have specified a different target website and I have used the parametrized &#8220;SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER&#8221; instead of the local BUILD_NUMBER environment variable.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_stage2_deploy.png" title="Deploy for Testing" /><br />
	Interface Tests &#8211; Deploy for Testing
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ll also configure the test results to be captured in the Post-build, just like the CI Build.</p>
<h3>Run the Automation Tests</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll download Nunit from the <a href="http://www.nunit.org/" title="Nunit.org">Nunit website</a> and install that on my server, then create the last two steps to put the correct configuration file in my assembly folder and run the Nunit testrunner to execute the tests. At this point I&#8217;ll also install Firefox on the server, as that is the browser I am automating for the tests.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_stage2_runtests.png" title="Run the Tests" /><br />
	Interface Tests &#8211; Run the Tests
</div>
<p>The first step is a basic copy command to copy the prepared &#8220;auto&#8221; config to &#8220;TestRun.config&#8221;, the file my test code will pick up when it starts. The Nunit command executes the nunit console against the compiled assembly, which runs all available test methods in the assembly, just as if I was running it from the GUI.</p>
<p><code class="codespan">"C:Program Files (x86)NUnit 2.5.10binnet-2.0nunit-console.exe" MvcMusicStore.InterfaceTestsbinDebugMvcMusicStore.InterfaceTests.dll /framework:net-4.0 /xml:SeleniumTestResult.xml</code></p>
<p>The last part, before I run my build again, is to import the results of the test run like like I did with MS Test and the smoke tests. The Nunit plugin has provided a &#8220;Publish Nunit test result report&#8221; section in the post-build options, so I&#8217;ll check that box and enter the xml path I specified for the output of the nunit-console command.</p>
<p>With that completed, I&#8217;ll run the test again to verify the results.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_stage2_failedrun.png" title="Failed Test" /><br />
	Interface Tests &#8211; Failed Test
</div>
<p>Hmm, that saves me the trouble of breaking the tests to make sure the results are accurate. It turns out when I was cleaning up absolute paths in the MVCMusicStore project I missed the link under the logo, so when the tests tried to navigate through that link they didn&#8217;t get to the page they were expecting and correctly failed the test.</p>
<p>Fix that issue, wait for the CI Build to run again, trigger this job with the number of that last CI Build and now I have a success.</p>
<h2>Wiring them Together</h2>
<p>The last step is to configure the CI Build to automatically trigger this new job when it completes. Opening the CI Build job, there is a new option in the Post-build configuration section that was added when I installed the &#8220;Trigger Parametrized Builds&#8221; plugin. I&#8217;ll add a &#8220;Predefined Parameter&#8221; with the same name as I used in the new job, SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER, and I&#8217;ll populate it with the local BUILD_NUMBER environment variable of the CI Build job.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_parameterized.png" title="Parameterized Build Trigger" /><br />
	CI Build &#8211; Parameterized trigger
</div>
<p>Saving the change, when I execute a CI job now, it successfully triggers an Automated Interface Test job on the build artifact it just completed.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>With a functioning CI Build job and a triggered automated test job, we&#8217;re in the home stretch. The last steps will be to implement a nice dashboard for these to provide a graphical representation of each individual build chain and to create build jobs to deploy to a QA and a production environment, the last two steps of my process diagram above.</p>

	Delivery Pipeline &#8211; Focus of Current Post
</div>
<p>This is the fifth post in a multi-part series on my Continuous Deployment pipeline project. The <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/UnitTest/continuous-delivery-project-incorporating-the" title="Continuous Delivery Project - Incorporating the Unit Tests">previous post</a> covered integrating unit tests into the Continuous Integration stage. This post will cover the final portion of that stage, an automated deployment of the site and smoke test to make sure it can be deployed in a working state.</p>
<h2>Preparing to Deploy</h2>
<p>The first thing we need in order to deploy is a web server. I initially intended to use a local IIS Express instance to do the test deployment but after some very long hours I decided to stop trying to make MSDeploy do something it obviously did not want to do. When the IIS Express idea fell through, I decided to use separate Applications on my newly created AVL-BETA-01 VM for different stages in my build pipeline, with a dedicated Application target just for this brief deploy-and-test step.</p>
<h3>Server Details:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Windows 2008 R2 VM, Patched and up to date</li>
<li>Installed Web Deploy 2.1 through Web Platform Installer (http://www.microsoft.com/web)</li>
<li>Added Web Server/IIS role to the server</li>
<li>In the Role Services for IIS, add the non-default Management Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Web Management service is a required service for web deploy, as it is the endpoint that exposes remote configuration capabilities to clients like WebDeploy. </p>
<ul>
<li>Created a build server account (buildsrvr) and set it up as a local admin (cheating), made it the runas acct for Web Management Service</li>
<li>Enabled Remote: Open IIS Manager, Click Management Service, Click enable remote, Apply</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/516/configure-the-web-deployment-handler/" title="Configure Web Deployment Handler">this guide</a>, I followed the steps to configure the web deployment handler. After several hours of wrestling with less-than-informative 401 permissions errors, even when doing local manual tests, I finally gave in and used the server&#8217;s local administrator account for my webdeploy scripts.</p>
<p><i>I&#8217;m very bitter about this 401 deal. There is a huge list of issues that can potentially happen and they all boiled down to just a few error messages. This whole matter would have been much easier if they had either (a) output detailed errors to the server event log, (b) given me the option on the server to put it into a promiscuous error mode temporarily to output more useful errors to the client, or (c) something in between. Offering the same exact message for multiple issues meant I had no idea when I was making changes whether I was fixing one of several problems or just making changes that had no effect.</i></p>
<p>The last step was to modify my target application pool to use .Net framework 4.0 (I cheated and used the default pool).</p>
<h2>Manually Deploying</h2>
<p>With the server setup, the last few steps were completed by trying to manually deploy the site to the target server. Opening a command prompt, I executed a variant of the following command to attempt to deploy my site package to the server:</p>
<p><code class="codespan">"C:Program FilesIISMicrosoft Web Deploy V2\msdeploy.exe" -source:package='c:Program Files (x86)JenkinsjobsASPNet MVC Music Store CI BuildworkspaceMvcMusicStoreobjReleasePackageMvcMusicStore.zip' -dest:auto,computerName='AVL-BETA-01',userName='AVL-BETA-01Administrator',password='MYPASSWORD',includeAcls='False' -verb:sync -disableLink:AppPoolExtension -disableLink:ContentExtension -disableLink:CertificateExtension -setParam:"IIS Web Application Name"="Default Web Site/MvcMusicStore_SmokeTest" -whatif</code></p>
<p>This command basically says that I want to deploy from the packaged zip file to the following destination, with the additional &#8220;IIS Web Application Name&#8221; parameters set to the name of the website and Application I want to deploy to on the server. The &#8220;-whatif&#8221; flag on the end tells MSDeploy that I want to do a simulated deployment. This causes MSDeploy to do all of the steps of doing a deployment short of actually copying the files up to the server. This was useful during the troubleshooting and configuration above.</p>
<h2>Deploying</h2>
<p>Removing the whatif flag, I can now try to do a full deployment. Unfortunately the site does not run, replying with an ASP.Net error screen that points out missing helper references. Following the helpful instructions <a href="http://mr.chriscompton.me/2011/11/assembly-errors/" title="Helper assembly errors">on this site</a>, I&#8217;ll modify my project properties to include the necessary libraries. After a fresh build and second manual deployment, the site loads correctly.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_deploy.png" title="Larger picture" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/config_deploy.png" title="Deployed to SmokeTest Location" /></a><br />
	Deployed to SmokeTest Location
</div>
<p>With the manual command successfully deploying, it&#8217;s now a simple matter to add a new step to my job to execute this same command on every build.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em; color: #666666;">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/firstdeploy.png" title="Larger picture" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/ContinuousDelivery/firstdeploy.png" title="Deployed Site" /></a><br />
Deployed Site
</div>
<p>To catch us up to date, the build is now getting latest from the code repository, building it, running the unit test suite, and successfully deploying it to IIS on a test server.</p>
<h2>Smoke Testing the Deployment</h2>
<p>Given how small this site is, the are only a few things I want to test on my deployed site to consider it a success. I&#8217;ll want to know that the site is available, that I deployed the version I just finished building, and that some data from the database is being displayed properly.</p>
<p>Looking through those requirements, I need three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A way to tell what version a deployed site is</li>
<li>A script to execute an HTTP Request against the site</li>
<li>A way to produce results my build engine understands</li>
</ol>
<h3>Version Numbers on the Site</h3>
<p>Adding a version number to the site is not too difficult. I&#8217;ll add a text file to my application that will be used to store the version number, along with some logic for the application begins to read that version number and store it.</p>

<p>With the application will displaying the value from the BuildVersion file, all that is left is to insert a step in my job to write the current build number to the file before the project is built and packaged up.</p>

	Adding Build Number to Site
</div>
<p>Ad the build number isadded as part of the CI build job, I&#8217;ll see the word &#8220;DEV&#8221; in my development environment and the appropriate build number everywhere else. Now I can automate tests to check for the expected build number and trace deployed sites back to their original build history.</p>
<h3>Smoke Testing Script</h3>
<p>Writing a script to test the deployed site is fairly straightforward and can be done in any of a dozen different languages. In order to fit my requirements above I need to be able to pass it a URL of the deployed site and a version number, and receive back some information to indicate whether my three test scenarios pass or fail. Because Jenkins has a built-in capability to parse Junit result files, I decided to add a third argument to indicate a test result file location and output the smoke test results as a file in Junit format.</p>
<p>I wrote my smoke test in VBScript and I don&#8217;t currently have it in a public repository, but I can make it available if anyone is curious (it&#8217;s not terribly complicated). The workflow of the script is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse the arguments</li>
<li>Perform an HTTP GET on the specified URL</li>
<li>Test 1: Check if the HTTP status code was a 200</li>
<li>Read the return content of the page as string</li>
<li>Test 2: Execute a regular expression test to verify the version number matches the one passed in as an arg</li>
<li>Test 3: Execute a regular expression test to verify some genre links were generated from the database</li>
<li>Output a Junit-compatible file to the location specified as an argument</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent sample of the output looks like this:<br />

<p>With the script built, all I need to do is add a final &#8220;Windows Batch Command&#8221; step to my job to execute this script.</p>

<p>And then configure the post-build step to import the result file as a Junit test result file.</p>

<p>With this method I not only get the tests executed as part of every build, but the results are nicely aggregated with the unit test results.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>With the Continuous Integration stage of the delivery pipeline built, it&#8217;s time to start focusing on the later steps of the process. The next post will introduce an automated interface job that picks up where the Continuous Integration stage leaves off to execute a set of Selenium + Nunit tests against a freshly deployed copy of the website.</p>
