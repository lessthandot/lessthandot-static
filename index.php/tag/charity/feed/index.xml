				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myself and 52 other SQL Server MVPs have been working on a SQL Server book for the past year or so.

<p>As you can see the list of authors of this book consist of a lot of well known SQL Server gurus who answer questions in newsgroups, write books, are involved with podcasts and have blogs. You probably already know most of these people.</p>
<p>I reviewed several chapters for this book and wrote two chapters myself; these chapters are Chapter 8 (What makes a bulk insert a minimally logged operation?) and chapter 20 (Why every SQL developer needs to have a tools database). One of the things I like about this book is that you can start reading any chapter you want; there is no need to first finish a number of different chapters before you will understand what the chapter you want to read about. All chapters are self contained. You want to learn how to optimize tempdb performance? Then read chapter 43.</p>
<p>All in all I think this book is good for any SQL Server developer/administrator. Amazon has the book listed at 37% off the list price, so hurry up and pre-order today. And if you are not a SQL Server developer/administrator, remember this could be a nice stocking stuffer for that DBA at work  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
