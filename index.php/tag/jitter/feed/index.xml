				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">You may or may not have noticed it after installing SQL Server 2012: the designer interface in Visual Studio 2010/2012 has had a make-over. Nothing too drastic, but at least the undo button works. However, sometimes when you drag or move tasks/components on the canvas, they start to shake. A lot. And very annoyingly as well. (Quite impossible to take a screenshot of that, so sorry). This behaviour emerged after applying CU6. There are Connect items logged about this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/790470/when-dragging-ssis-objects-on-canvas-the-objects-shake-jiggle-jitter">When dragging SSIS objects on canvas the objects shake/jiggle/jitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/776664/ssis-2012-control-flow-moving-objects-is-unusable">SSIS 2012 Control Flow moving objects is unusable</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Luckily Microsoft patched this bug in CU7. You can download the hotfix <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2883424/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0">here</a>. If your environment is up-to-date with the latest patches, most likely you won&#8217;t experience this bug.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I patched the Visual Studio 2010 environment at the client and the issue went away. But at home I use Visual Studio 2012 and the issue was still there, even after applying the fix. Fortunately, Twitter was there with the answer:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ko_Ver">@Ko_Ver</a> Ok, because the CU that fixes that only updates the DLL&#8217;s for VS2010, you need to manually overwrite the assemblies in VS2012 folder</p>
<p>â€” Jan Van humbeek (@janvanhumbeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/janvanhumbeek/status/517569881672544256">October 2, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you go back to the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/790470/when-dragging-ssis-objects-on-canvas-the-objects-shake-jiggle-jitter">first Connect item</a>, these steps are described in the work arounds and they work like a charm.</p>
<p>The issue has also been <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/1013088/ssis-2014-control-flow-moving-objects-is-unusable">reported for SSIS 2014</a>, and while the item has been closed as fixed, there&#8217;s no explanation on how it is fixed. Maybe in an upcoming CU for SQL Server 2014? It&#8217;s possible the same work around works for SSIS 2014, but I haven&#8217;t tried it (I don&#8217;t have the bug in Visual Studio 2013) so if you do try it, it&#8217;s at your own risk.</p>
