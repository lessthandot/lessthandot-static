				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Books/TheThankYouEconomy.jpg?mtime=1325953427"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Books/TheThankYouEconomy.jpg?mtime=1325953427" width="210" height="317" /></a></div>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061914185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061914185">The Thank You Economy by Gary Vaynerchuk</a></strong><br />
If your company is thinking about jumping on the social media bandwagon then this book is required reading. You should be able to finish this book in one sitting, it is only 256 pages. The length of the book is one of the plus points, if you give it to someone in your marketing or pr department, the chance is much higher that they will actually read it compared to a book that is 800 pages.</p>
<p>The book is filled with useful information about how companies use social media to engage their clientele, how they win new customers and how they can get back customers after they messed up.</p>
<p>I like the chapter that showed how Avaya was monitoring twitter and heled someone out who had some problems with communication systems, that person bought $250K equipment from Avaya. If Avaya only used twitter to blast out press release they would have never made this sale. This is one of the main points that I took away from the book, engage with the people that follow you&#8230;don&#8217;t become just a RSS feed. A customer who complains on twitter is better than one who complains and you don&#8217;t know about it, you can do something about the one on twitter, engage with him/her, find out why he/she is dissatisfied and fix the problem. Changes are this customer will be as vocal if you provide a good service, it is better to engage than to ignore this person.</p>
<p>Another good point that Gary Vaynerchuk is making is that we have metrics now with social media, if you had an ad in a magazine or on television then you would never know how many people actually saw the ad. With social media, you can see retweets, likes and plusses, you can also see how many followers you have. All this is powerful stuff that will help you build your brand by focusing on the stuff that works.</p>
<p>If your company doesn&#8217;t know what twitter or facebook is then this book alone will not help them, this book is not technical in nature, it is geared towards business people. You will need to educate them on how to set this all up.</p>
<p><strong>Who this book is not (really) for.</strong><br />
If you are already a twitter/facebook/Google+ user who doesn&#8217;t use it as a glorified pr news outlet to only do one way communication by never engaging with your user, this is not really the book for you. You might pick up some ideas here and there and learn how some companies learned from their mistakes but in general you are using social media as it should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
This book is a must read for any company that either is not using social media or is using it just as a glorified press release platform. The real world examples in the book are a must read to really understand how you can succeed by using social media to grow your business</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most companies reach a point in their lives when they realize that they aren&#8217;t entirely sure what IT resources they have, how they&#8217;re deployed, what direction they&#8217;re headed, or whether they&#8217;re ready for the next big shift from the business. Some companies visit this point multiple times, either in response to shifts in the company or business landscape or as a result of letting the environment devolve back into it&#8217;s primordial beginnings.</p>
<h2>IT/Business/Enterprise Architecture</h2>
<p>Today I&#8217;m offering up two books with tools and ideas to help us analyze our environments, align them with the business, and build frameworks or architectures for our environment that enable our business, rather than hold them back. The first book provides a basic framework, while the second communicates the importance of architecture to executive and non-IT personnel.</p>

   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Toolkit-Jane-Carbone/dp/0131473794" title="IT Architecture Toolkit"><img src="http://tiernok.com/_n_images/books/at.jpg" alt="IT Architecture Toolkit" /></a><br />
   IT Architecture Toolkit
</div>
<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Toolkit-Jane-Carbone/dp/0131473794" title="IT Architecture Toolkit at Amazon">IT Architecture Toolkit</a><br />Jane A. Carbone</h3>
<p>This is a self-declared &#8216;Practical Guide&#8217; to enterprise architecture, aiming to help us get the work done without the depth of knowledge and practice that a full-time, experienced enterprise architect would bring to the table. There is little filler in this book, going straight from why architecture is important to the company into methods to analyze the current situation and defining a path forward. By the end of the process we have not only a vision and defined goal, but also projects, methods of estimating, metrics, assistance getting buy-in, and so on. <br />
The practices and methods described in the book will be familiar to those with more background in business or enterprise architecture, but are just as approachable for those that have not had the time to delve into these subjects. Even if you aren&#8217;t ready for a full blown architectural initiative, the ideas presented in many of the chapters are just as useful on a day-to-day IT management basis and provide good supplemental material.<br />

<div style="float: left; padding: .5em; width: 170px; margin: 0em .5em .5em 0px; border: 1px solid #dddddd; color: #666666; font-size: .8em; text-align: center; position: relative;">
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Architecture-Strategy-Foundation-Execution/dp/1591398398" title="Enterprise Architecture as Strategy at Amazon"><img src="http://tiernok.com/_n_images/books/eapas.jpg" alt="Enterprise Architecture as Strategy" /></a><br />
   Enterprise Architecture as Strategy
</div>
<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Architecture-Strategy-Foundation-Execution/dp/1591398398" title="Enterprise Architecture as Strategy">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a><br />Jeanne W. Ross, Peter Weill, David C. Robertson</h3>
<p>Probably the hardest part of any IT initiative is explaining to executives and managers why we need to do it. Enterprise Architecture as Strategy focuses on that communication, on explaining to a non-IT executive what the value is of IT alignment with the business and a process for achieving that alignment between IT and the business. The advantage this book brings is not depth of detail into Enterprise Architecture models or practices, but the business viewpoint of the value of Enterprise Architecture and the language and methods it uses to communicate that language. This is not a for-technologists-by-technologists book, but rather closer to a for-the-business-by-the-business voice, and that difference in perspective is especially useful.</p>
<p><br style="clear: left" /></p>
<p>Love or hate the term &#8220;IT/Business Alignment&#8221;, there are still thousands of IT groups and businesses that are working towards disparate goals (or no goals at all). Books like the two above, as well as many others in the EA space, can help us get a better picture of where we are, build a direction for where we should be going, improve the position and agility of our business, and provide a number of tools that are usable even in day-to-day operation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My goal for this year is to read 50 books. At this point I have read 27 books, so I am a little ahead. I decided to tackle the Stieg Larsson trilogy as well as the Baroque Cycle trilogy.</p>
<h2>First quarter 2011</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/5893969692/" title="What I read so far this year 1st quarter 2011 by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5301/5893969692_6ddb5088e7.jpg" width="500" height="319" alt="What I read so far this year 1st quarter 2011" /></a></p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553380958">Snow Crash</a> by Neal Stephenson<br />
Hiro Protagonist&#8211;hacker, samurai swordsman, and pizza-delivery drive is living in the Metaverse and people start frying their brains from the designer drug called Snow Crash. Interesting book, really enjoyed the 2nd half of the book, the first part was hard to get into</p>
<p>2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318415/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0765318415">Boneshaker</a> by Cherie Priest<br />
A steampunk book, it has people turning into zombies from some gas that inventor Leviticus Blue released when drilling into the core of the earth. One scene reminded me of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, not the best book but still entertaining</p>
<p>3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399144463/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0399144463">Who moved my cheese?</a> by Spencer Johnson<br />
Horrible, horrible reviews on Amazon. Still an interesting story of how to cope with change (or maybe being agile) Probably very suited for people in IT who complain about scope creep, changing requirements and needing to keep their skill set up to date.</p>
<p>4) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060850523/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060850523">Brave New World</a> by Aldous Huxley<br />
It was interesting&#8230;I am sure it was eye opening and way ahead of its time when it was published in 1932. Some interesting things like the use of Our Ford (instead of Our Lord and of course the assembly lines that Ford first used which is I guess a metaphor for life in the World State). Soma&#8230;the good feel drug&#8230;.I wonder how he came up with that one. Reminded me of 1984, the matrix and V for Vendetta.At times it was difficult to read..and I had to re-read paragraphs.</p>
<p>5) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143112392/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143112392">The War of the World</a> by Niall Ferguson<br />
This book is about the conflicts in the 20th century and maybe a reminder what could be waiting for us????</p>
<p>6) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393338827/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393338827">The big short</a> by Michael Lewis<br />
The best book I read so far this year&#8230;.deals with the financial crisis of 2007/2008 but written in a very witty way&#8230;very much like Liar&#8217;s Poker..his first book&#8230;highly recommended</p>
<p>7) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439192561/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439192561">Full Dark, No Stars</a> by Stephen King<br />
Probably his best book in a looooooong time, this one has 4 short stories and some of them are real creepy.</p>
<p>8) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385129912/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0385129912">Night Shift</a> by Stephen King<br />
Short stories, you probably know some of them like Children of the Corn or Graveyard Shift. Some interesting stories, I liked this book, I don&#8217;t really think you can go wrong with a Stephen King book.</p>
<p>9) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439149089/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439149089">Zombie Spaceship Wasteland</a> by Patton Oswalt<br />
This is a comedy book written by a comedian..nothing to do with zombies..pretty funny at times</p>
<p>10) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047052670X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=047052670X">How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes</a> by Peter D. Schiff and Andrew J. Schiff<br />
Interesting book, explaining why we have the crisis and why Quantitative Easing is not the solution&#8230;also everything is explained with stories on a small island..highly recommended</p>
<p>11) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> by Stieg Larsson<br />
A female hacker and a journalist are investigating a murder from decades ago. I really really liked this book. Some trivia..Stieg Larsson died while walking up the stairs to his publisher delivering the manuscripts..he never saw the books published!!!</p>
<p>12) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MPRWOQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MPRWOQ">The Coke Machine: The Dirty Truth Behind the World&#8217;s Favorite Soft Drink</a> by Michael Blanding<br />
History of Coca Cola, how it started, how it is very ruthless against anything that stands in its way, this of course also includes schools that want to eliminate soda from the lunchroom. Very interesting book, highly recommended.</p>
<p>13) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00457X86M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B00457X86M">A Heartbeat Away</a> by Michael Palmer<br />
Reminded me of a cross between Dan Brown and Richard Preston(The Cobra Event, The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer) During the President&#8217;s State of the Union address, a terrorist releases a bio-agent with potentially fatal consequences, the only man who can save the group is a scientist the President has had locked away for treason. I really enjoyed this book.</p>
<p>14) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VTZTU8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B003VTZTU8">Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks</a> by Ben Goldacre<br />
This book attacks doctors motivated by money, pharmaceutical companies and poorly designed studies.</p>
<h2>Second quarter 2011</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/5893445475/" title="What I read so far this year 2nd quarter 2011 by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5308/5893445475_2ebe701cc7.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="What I read so far this year 2nd quarter 2011" /></a></p>
<p>15) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060833165/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060833165">Quicksilver (The Baroque Cycle No. 1)</a> by Neal Stephenson<br />
Some people would like to call this math fiction instead of science fiction, this book has Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz and other famous characters. It is a long book and takes place in several cities, one of them is Amsterdam. What really bugged me is that Stephenson mentions the IJsselmeer, well until 1932 this was still de Zuiderzee, so there is no way this existed in the 16 century.<br />
Besides the factual inconsistencies I liked the book and the characters it has, for some reason it reminded me a little of Anna Karenina.</p>
<p>16)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WUYQNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B003WUYQNW"> Professional SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting</a> by Christian Bolton, Justin Langford, Brent Ozar, James Rowland-Jones, Jonathan Kehayias, Cindy Gross  and Steven Wort<br />
A must read if you need to troubleshoot any performance problem with SQL Server, can&#8217;t recommend it enough.</p>
<p>17) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEHIG2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B000SEHIG2">The Selfish Gene</a> by Richard Dawkins<br />
A gene&#8217;s eye view of evolution, really interesting book, highly recommended.</p>
<p>18) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UBTX72/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B003UBTX72">Life</a> by Keith Richards<br />
Although Keith Richards has some tendencies of megalomania, I liked this book. Nothing earth shattering that we did not know already but still intersting to hear it from the person himself.</p>
<p>19) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NX75E0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B003NX75E0">The End of Wall Street</a> by Roger Lowenstein<br />
A behind the scenes analysis of th crash of 2008 and what caused it. Hopefully we will learn from this. This was a good book and I really liked it.</p>

The final book in this trilogy. This trilogy is awesome, it is too bad Stieg Larsson passed away, I would have loved to read more about Lisbeth Salander, Blomkvist and the rest of the characters</p>
<p>25) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047Y0FGY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0047Y0FGY">Bossypants</a> by Tina Fey<br />
A fun book from a funny woman</p>
<p>26)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140278676X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=140278676X"> The King&#8217;s Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy</a> by Mark Logue<br />
I didn&#8217;t see the movie, so nothing was spoiled for me. A good book detailing how King George VI overcam his speech problem and what actually caused these problems.</p>
<p>27) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061122416/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0061122416">The Alchemist</a> by Paulo Coelho<br />
A shepherd is looking for a treasure, he travels a lot to find the treasure not where he expected it. This is a pretty short book and will remind you of a fairy tale in a way. I liked this book even if the characters lack dept and the book is very simple.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone I know has over 10 years experience with managing Sybase and Oracle boxes. He now needs to also manage some SQL Server boxes. What books would you recommend?  This is to manage 2008 instances, there are no 2000 instances anymore  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Ted Krueger gave me the following recommendation</p>
<blockquote><p>10 years experience on any database server should give a solid foundation so I&#8217;d venture into throwing him into the deep end with a book like Profesisonal SQL Server 2008 internals and troubleshooting </p>
<p>That book is good and has a great foundation for SQL Server itself. Of course the problem is, it is 2008. We all know 2008 is great but how many are on 2005 and some 2000. So the book recommendations would still cause headaches when finding answers and trying them when you are hitting a wall with rewriting for DMV changes etc.. </p>
<p>Now jumping in deep. Grab Kalen, Adam, Conor, Kimberly and Pauls book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735626243?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735626243">SQL Server Internals</a></p>
<p>That one is hardcore. I still really like Rod&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193398872X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=193398872X">SQL Server 2008 Administration in Action</a>. That read was a nice level for a person with a solid background. </p>
<p>Grants book on query tuning is awesome. Even if this one is 2008, it is a foundation. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219025?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430219025">SQL Server 2008 Query Performance Tuning Distilled</a></p>
<p>Pushing more Fritchey work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906434026?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906434026">the execution plans book</a> he did for Red Gate is my one way admin execution plan tuning reference. I never leave home without it  It doesn&#8217;t go through the 70+ operations but it shows the main ones and creates a foundation of how the optimizer does things along with the effect on those and tuning them. Tuning is a big DBA task to me so learning that off the bat is critical IMO
</p></blockquote>
<p>Some other people recommended some books as well, I am thinking of these 3 books now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071700641?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0071700641">Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Administration for Oracle DBAs</a><br />

<p>What do you think, leave me a comment if you can think of something else. Remember this will be for an administrator, he doesn&#8217;t have to know how the ROW_NUMBER() function works</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was tagged by <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/what-was-your-first-computer-and-what-we">onpnt</a> in his <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/goals-for-2010">2010 Goals</a> post. So here is my short list of goals that I would like to accomplish in 2010</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/logo-header-sql08-dg.gif" alt="Upgrade our servers to SQL Server 2008" title="Upgrade our servers to SQL Server 2008" width="363" height="75" /></div>
<h2>Upgrade our servers to SQL Server 2008</h2>
<p>This is an easy one since it already happened this week. We went to new machines from machines that were 6 years old. I now have 16 times more RAM than previously. Instead of 4 HT CPUs I now have 8 CPUs and finally I am no longer on SQL Server 2000 at all. I really am glad that we upgraded; now I can use built in partitioned functions instead of the partitioned views I had to create to made that old box perform as well as it did. There is a ton of other stuff that we utilize now, here is just a tip of the iceberg: mirroring, date datatype, compression.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/3167236184_4c5385c657_m.jpg" alt="Read 2 books per month" title="Read 2 books per month" /></div>
<h2>Read 2 books per month</h2>
<p>There was a time when I commuted to NYC from Princeton and would read between 50 and 60 books per year. Now that my commute is mostly walking I don’t read that much, I like to increase that. So far I already have finished one book, this book is called Deamon and I already blogged about it here: <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/daemon-by-daniel-suarez-is-a-book-every">Daemon by Daniel Suarez is a book every programmer will love</a><br />
One way to read more is by using audio books, this way you can listen at the gym, while you are walking around etc etc. Audio books are sometimes read by really good people. A couple of audio books I really enjoyed are: Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress, and Daemon. Audio books really add another dimension to an already interesting book. For example those creepy synthetic voices in Daemon really bring the book to life. Some of the books that are on my list for this year are below.</p>
<p>Stephen King: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416586652?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1416586652">Just After Sunset</a><br />

<p>Since it is only January I am sure that some SQL Server 2008 R2 Analysis books that deal with PowerPivot will be added to this list. Also after Visual Studio 2010 comes up I will pick up some C# 4.0 and .NET 4.0 books</p>

<h2>Be more active in the SQL community</h2>
<p>I am pretty active with blogging and on twitter but I took somewhat a hiatus in regards to answering questions in newsgroups forums/fora. This will change; starting next week I will pick up the slack again. I will also commit to writing 2 blog posts per week. Right now I have 247 blog posts on this site; it should be at 350 by the end of this year.</p>

<h2>Watch more television</h2>
<p>For some people this might seem strange because they would probably want to decrease the amount of television that they watch. I really watch maybe 2 or 3 hours of television a week and even then it is just mostly flipping channels. The show I watch most is House hunters International on HGTV. Just to show you how little television  I watch, here is a list of show I have never even seen one episode of<br />
Simpsons, Family guy, Lost, CSI (any flavor), Seinfeld, Baywatch, X files, 24, Frazier and this list goes on and on.<br />
When I do watch shows it is mostly on HBO or Showtime, I love Sopranos, Oz, True Blood, Dexter, Californication…basically shows that run for 13 weeks and that don’t skip 2 months like for example Jericho. Jericho was of course the one network show I truly like and it was cancelled.</p>

<h2>Play more computer games</h2>
<p>There was a time when I played games on the computer at least a couple of day a week, this is when I had my Commodore 128 in the 1980s, I blogged about that here: <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/what-was-your-first-computer-and-what-we">What was your first computer and what were some of your favorite games? </a><br />
These days I think the games are too complicated or you need to spend several hours just to learn how to play this game. I like my games to be simple..I have a weapon..you move ..I shoot. Games should be to relax not a commitment, if you don&#8217;t play for a week suddenly a whole bunch of people have higher levels than you in WoW.</p>
<p>So that is it&#8230;nothing major really&#8230;I decided not to tag anyone since it is already practically the middle of January.</p>
