				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone took all the good things already so I‚Äôm here with the leftovers but still things I call the pet peeves and I wouldn‚Äôt miss.  So here is the big five that came to mind</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/bullet.gif" alt="" title="" width="50" height="42" align="left" /></div>
<h3>Default Configurations</h3>
<p>OK, defaults help everyone.  Mostly they help them not actually think about what they are doing.  My first call to the drop spree is roughly 90% of all the defaults.  Make us think about it!  Is making us enter something really that bad of a thing?  Maybe it will catch another 1% of the installers if they actually have to think.  They may actually say, ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶wonder what that means.  I‚Äôll go find out before putting a 1MB in that growth box‚Äù.  We have the ability to optimize our own default settings so leave it to us.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/bullet.gif" alt="" title="" width="50" height="42" align="left" /></div>
<h3>MSDTC usage</h3>
<p>Can we please come up with something that is actually stable by now??? All I think I have to say about that.  Really, all there is to say about it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/bullet.gif" alt="" title="" width="50" height="42" align="left" /></div>
<h3>MAX Memory settings</h3>
<p>SQL Server is an intelligent beastly database server.  I mean, smart!  So why does SQL Server let people put 2TB into the max memory settings when they have 4GB of RAM?  Drop that!  And if I catch any of you leaving 2147483647 as the default, your DBA days are numbered.  SQL Server will act as fast as a cookie monster with memory cookies if you let it. </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/bullet.gif" alt="" title="" width="50" height="42" align="left" /></div>
<h3>Everyone will hate me and disagree on this, but can we get rid of db_datareader and db_datawriter already?</h3>
<p>Security isn‚Äôt that complex.  Really, it isn‚Äôt.  They need SELECT on this so you bottle it role and they have it.  How many times do you just click db_datareader when they ‚Äújust‚Äù need read rights?  The same thing goes for db_datawriter.  Well, they need write access to the DB so give it to them.  Do they need write to ALL of it?  No one can give me the excuse that your security would simply be far too complex to setup or you have hundreds of thousands of users.  Hey, if you use all the containers and roles in which you setup right, it actually makes it easier to maintain <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Really, if a db_datareader or db_datawriter is needed, then create it. Don‚Äôt leave it as a big red button to be pushed far too many times.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/bullet.gif" alt="" title="" width="50" height="42" align="left" /></div>
<h3>Last but nowhere near least; xp_cmdshell.</h3>
<p>We have far too many good tools like CLR now to need that bugger.  Let‚Äôs start to use them and just take this thing out for good.  Bring back the blank SA passwords if you leave this thing open to people executing it.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been tagged by <a href="http://twitter.com/AaronBertrand">Aaron Bertrand</a> in the latest SQL meme: <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/aaron_bertrand/archive/2010/05/11/tagged-5-things-sql-server-should-drop.aspx">Tagged: 5 things SQL Server should drop</a>. This meme is about five thing that you wished that were dropped from SQL Server. Actually I prefer that SQL Server adds stuff instead of removes stuff, I can always ingore the things I don&#8217;t like. Anyhow since this is about things that should be removed, here is my list.</p>
<h3>Isnumeric</h3>
<p>The isnumeric function is something that can bring you into trouble without you even knowing it, for example run these queries</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span>&nbsp; <span class="kw2">ISNUMERIC</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="kw1">CHAR</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="nu0">9</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw2">ISNUMERIC</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'1D2'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw2">ISNUMERIC</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'.'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw2">ISNUMERIC</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'-'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw2">ISNUMERIC</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'+'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select	ISNUMERIC(CHAR(9)),
		ISNUMERIC('1D2'),
		ISNUMERIC('.'),
		ISNUMERIC('-'),
		ISNUMERIC('+')</pre></div></div>

<p>Really a tab (Char(9) is numeric?  I would be much better if SQL Server had IsInteger, IsFloat,IsTinyInteger functions or perhaps the ability to pass in the the type to isnumeric<br />
Something like this</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">SELECT</span> <span class="kw2">ISNUMERIC</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'123'</span>, <span class="st0">'TinyInt'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SELECT ISNUMERIC('123', 'TinyInt')</pre></div></div>

<h3>Restrictions on Indexed Views</h3>
<p>Lookup indexed views and you will see more restrictions than you can fathom, you can&#8217;t memorize these things either, there are too many. First you need a bunch of setting</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">SET</span> NUMERIC_ROUNDAB<span class="sy0">OR</span>T <span class="kw1">OFF</span>;
<span class="kw1">SET</span> ANSI_PADD<span class="sy0">IN</span>G, ANSI_WARN<span class="sy0">IN</span>GS, CONCAT_<span class="sy0">NULL</span>_YIELDS_<span class="sy0">NULL</span>, ARITHAB<span class="sy0">OR</span>T,
&nbsp; &nbsp; QUOTED_IDENTIFIER, ANSI_<span class="sy0">NULL</span>S <span class="kw1">ON</span>;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SET NUMERIC_ROUNDABORT OFF;
SET ANSI_PADDING, ANSI_WARNINGS, CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL, ARITHABORT,
    QUOTED_IDENTIFIER, ANSI_NULLS ON;</pre></div></div>

<p>Why not replace that with</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">SET</span> CREATE_<span class="sy0">IN</span>DEXED_VIEW_SETT<span class="sy0">IN</span>GS <span class="kw1">ON</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SET CREATE_INDEXED_VIEW_SETTINGS ON</pre></div></div>

<p>This would be similar to ANSI_DEFAULTS, that sets 7 other settings to ON or OFF</p>
<p>After you are done with all these settings you have a whole laundry list of restrictions. Some of these restriction seems a little restricting to me, I have heard that other RDBMS vendors don&#8217;t have some of these restrictions in their materialized views.</p>
<h3>Ordered views</h3>
<p>Take away the ability to create an ordered view since it is ignored anyway.<br />
So for example if you create this view, which was working nicely in SQL Server 2000</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">CREATE</span> <span class="kw1">VIEW</span> vTestSort
<span class="kw1">AS</span>
<span class="kw1">SELECT</span> <span class="kw1">TOP</span> <span class="nu0">100</span> <span class="kw1">PERCENT</span> id <span class="kw1">FROM</span> TestSort
<span class="kw1">ORDER</span> <span class="kw1">BY</span> id</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">CREATE VIEW vTestSort
AS
SELECT TOP 100 PERCENT id FROM TestSort
ORDER BY id</pre></div></div>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t work in 2005 or 2008</p>
<p>OF course you can do this and it will &#8216;work&#8217; and I wrote about it here: <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/create-a-sorted-view-in-sql-server-2005--2008">Create a sorted view in SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008</a></p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">CREATE</span> <span class="kw1">VIEW</span> vTestSort2
<span class="kw1">AS</span>
<span class="kw1">SELECT</span> <span class="kw1">TOP</span> <span class="nu0">99.99</span> <span class="kw1">PERCENT</span> &nbsp;id <span class="kw1">FROM</span> TestSort
<span class="kw1">ORDER</span> <span class="kw1">BY</span> id</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">CREATE VIEW vTestSort2
AS
SELECT TOP 99.99 PERCENT  id FROM TestSort
ORDER BY id</pre></div></div>

<p>I say get rid of that, if people want the view to be in a specific order then specify  ORDER BY&#8230;how lazy can you be?</p>
<h3>Unique constraints with one NULL value</h3>
<p>This is a great interview question and that is the only usefulness of this constraint. Either allow multiple NULL values or disallow NULL values.<br />
Of course you can now use a Filtered Index in 2008 to accomplish this</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">create</span> <span class="kw1">unique</span> <span class="kw1">nonclustered</span> <span class="kw1">index</span> IX_LookMaMultipleNullValues <span class="kw1">on</span> dbo.<span class="me1">SomeTable</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span>SomeColumn<span class="br0">&#41;</span>
<span class="kw1">where</span> SomeColumn <span class="kw1">is</span> not null;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">create unique nonclustered index IX_LookMaMultipleNullValues on dbo.SomeTable(SomeColumn)
where SomeColumn is not null;</pre></div></div>

<p>But not everyone is on 2008</p>
<h3>Functions that are very similar</h3>
<p>Aaron already touched upon this with timestamp and rowversion in his post. SQL Server has a bunch of function that are very similar, I think we should retire some of those. Here is a list.</p>
<p><strong>ISNULL and COALESCE</strong><br />
Those are not really the same, COALESCE allows for more than 1 expressions, preserves the datatype and is ANSI standard. So why do we need ISNULL? I know, I know..someone will post that ISNULL performs better&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p><strong>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  and GETDATE()</strong><br />
Banish GETDATE() and use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  instead, the only reason people (me included) use GETDATE() is because we are lazy and it is shorter. As a matter of fact use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP when you create  a table and then script the table out&#8230;what do you see? It will be GETDATE()</p>
<p><strong>User functions</strong></p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got tagged by Denny Cherry (<a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/sql-server/how-i-got-started-in-it/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/mrdenny">twitter</a>) who himself got tagged by Brent Ozar (<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2009/04/starting-the-sql-journey/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/brento">twitter</a>), they want to know how I got started with SQL Server.</p>
<p>So here is my story. My first database was not SQL Server but DB2 running on a mainframe; this was about 10 years ago and back then you did not have fancy keyword highlighting because everything was green and in CAPS&#8230;oh the memories of SPUFI, MVS, COBOL, JCL and CICS&#8230;good riddance!</p>
<p><strong>Silicon Alley Job</strong><br />
I January 2000 I started to work in Silicon Alley (21st and Broadway). I started as an <s>ancient</s> classic ASP developer hitting an Access database (this got converted to SQL Server 6.5 or 7), do any of you remember <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/chilisoft/">Chilisoft ASP</a>? Then I switched from ASP to ColdFusion which was basically very similar to VB but you put everything in tags and prefixed it with CF&#8230;so for example </p>
<pre>&lt;cfif expression&gt;
   HTML and CFML tags
&lt;cfelseif expression&gt;
   HTML and CFML tags 
&lt;cfelse&gt;
   HTML and CFML tags
&lt;/cfif&gt;</pre>
<p>When I developed in ColdFusion we were using SQL Server 7 and we actually used stored procs and parameters instead of cfquery with inline SQL. After that we used JSP and also ATG Dynamo. The company I worked for was a GREAT design company, they won a ton of awards. We had this  art director who made sure that everything looked the same on Netscape 4.7, IE 5, IE 5.5 for the Mac etc etc. I would sometime spend 3 hours to make sure that something looked the same on all browser only to be told that it is off by 1 pixel on IE 5.5. This person was one of the reasons I liked DB work more and more and front end programming less and less (probably helped by the fact that I don&#8217;t have any design skills). For the last project we used SQL Server 2000 and then after September 11 2001 we did not get any new work. We all got laid off in October and it took me about 4 weeks to find a new job.</p>
<p><strong>Midtown Job</strong><br />
This new job was for SQL only, no front end work at all. The job was for 2 months, it got extended to 4, then 6 and then they made me full time and I stayed with them for 3.6 years. For the first 3 months all I was doing was creating DTS packages. This job was great for me, it was walking distance from the Upper East Side where I lived (it was about 50 blocks but I consider that walking distance :-)) The people were great and we had flexible hours; sometimes I would start at 7 sometimes at 9. At this job I had to interact with NJ Transit, LIRR, MNRR, New York City Transit, State of New Jersey and City of New York. The interesting thing is that they give you a file in a format that they choose and you also have to create a file in their format. At this job is also were we got saved by a SQL cluster, we put a cluster in place and a week after that the motherboard got fried&#8230;that was good timing. I did the usual SQL stuff here like DTS, creating procs, creating data models etc. etc. etc. Of course we didn&#8217;t have a SQL admin so we were the accidental DBAs. I worked with 4 other SQL developers on a big project but usually it was only 2 SQL developers. I moved to Princeton New Jersey after being at this job for about 2 years. After over 3 years at this job our big client was acting suspicious and doing some things that were indicators that they were going to drop us. I started to look for a new job, I got an interview with a company 4 miles from my home and during the 5 hours interview we all got laid off. Luckily for me the company made me an offer the same day and my last day was June 30 and the old place and July 1st at the new place.</p>
<p><strong>Princeton Job</strong><br />
I have been a little over 4 years now at my current job, I am still a SQL developer and almost don&#8217;t do any DBA kind of things. I am still doing a lot of SSIS, importing and exporting data, doing some SSIS (but no SSRS). I also have to work with different databases like Sybase IQ, Access and FoxPro, then you have a bunch of different text files and Excel files that you need to import and export. We already have SQL 2008 boxes and will be only on 2008 on 7 boxes sometimes in the fall. The biggest challenge at this job is how to make a lot of data perform well. I have employed &#8216;tricks&#8217; like partitioned views (on SQL 2000) and this made queries much faster. Currently I am testing with compression, vertical partitioning and partition function and I am seeing queries go down from a second to 17 millisecond, going to 2008 looks good.</p>
<p>I will also tag some people, the list is below<br />

<p>As you can see SQL rules here, I wonder why????</p>
<p>So how did I create this image? I used <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a>, Wordle is a toy for generating ‚Äúword clouds‚Äù from text that you provide. The clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source text. You can tweak your clouds with different fonts, layouts, and color schemes</p>
