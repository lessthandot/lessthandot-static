				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, the following was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">announced</a></p>
<blockquote><p>We launched Google Reader in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with Google Takeout over the course of the next four months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Damn, I love my Google reader. Today my fellow LessThanDot member <a href="https://twitter.com/damber">damber</a> told me about feedly</p>
<p>Feedly exists for the following platforms and browsers</p>
<p>Feedly for iOS<br />
Feedly for Android<br />
Feedly for Chrome<br />
Feedly for Firefox<br />
Feedly for Safari</p>
<p>Feedly will connect to Google Reader and import all your stuff.<br />
I decided to give the Chrome plugin a try, here is what it looks like</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/8557317305/" title="Feedly list by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8557317305_14e215d534_z.jpg" width="640" height="330" alt="Feedly list" /></a></p>
<p>I also like the way you can organize the feeds, much better than Google reader IMHO</p>

<p>I am also very happy that the j and k keyboard shortcuts work</p>
