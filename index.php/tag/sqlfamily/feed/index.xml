<li>Brent Ozar</li>
<li>Paul Randal</li>
<li>Thomas LaRock</li>
<li>Pinal Dave</li>
</ul>
<p>Suffice to say I am a little bit of the underdog here. With this blog post, I encourage you to go to the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TribalAwards2014SSC">Tribal Awards voting page</a>¬†and vote for this blog.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month‚Äôs <a href="http://realsqlguy.com/invite-for-tsql2sday-59-my-hero/">T-SQL Tuesday</a> is hosted by Tracy McKibben (<a href="http://realsqlguy.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/RealSQLGuy">twitter</a>) and is all about heroes (not the TV show).</p>
<p><a href="http://realsqlguy.com/invite-for-tsql2sday-59-my-hero/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2241" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TSQL2sday.png" alt="TSQL2sday" width="133" height="134" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ada Lovelace has been an inspiration to many. In keeping with my blog theme, let‚Äôs call her a hero. We all have our heroes, those people who we admire, who inspire us, who we strive to be like. Who is your hero?</em></p>
<p><em>Your assignment is to acknowledge, in writing, your hero (or heroes). You don‚Äôt have to mention them by name if you‚Äôre not comfortable doing so, but you do have to tell us how you met them, how they have inspired you, and what qualities or traits of theirs you have striven to adopt.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I was thinking for the past week about my heroes and I decided to give you a shortlist of SQL Server people who had some influence on me during my BI career.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jamie Thomson (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jamie_thomson/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiet">twitter</a>) aka SSISJunkie. When I started out with BI and mainly SSIS, his blog taught me a lot about SSIS. I still use his naming conventions every day in my SSIS packages.</li>
<li>Chris Webb (<a href="http://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Technitrain">twitter</a>). He was the first ‚Äúinternational‚Äù speaker I saw live on a SQL Server conference. He lives and breathes SSAS and his little pinky toe knows more about MDX than I ever will (that isn‚Äôt hard to accomplish though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Steve Jones (<a href="http://voiceofthedba.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/way0utwest">twitter</a>), Grant Fritchey (<a href="http://www.scarydba.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GFritchey">twitter</a>), Gail Shaw (<a href="http://sqlinthewild.co.za/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/SQLintheWild">twitter</a>) and Jeff Moden + other regulars at the <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/">SQLServerCentral</a> forums. Their knowledge and untiring effort on the forums still amazes me day after day. Special thanks to Jeff, Jedi of set-based thinking and master of the tally table, for teaching me through his articles how to make my queries a thousand times faster.</li>
<li>Rafal Luckawiecki (<a href="https://projectbotticelli.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaldotnet">twitter</a>) and Buck Woody (<a href="http://buckwoody.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/buckwoody">twitter</a>) because they are such amazing speakers. Their level of expertise in bringing a message across to an audience is what I strive to have someday. If you are on event and one of them are speaking, try the catch a session, you won‚Äôt regret it.</li>
<li>Brent Ozar (<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/BrentO">twitter</a>) and Thomas LaRock (<a href="http://thomaslarock.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/SQLRockstar">twitter</a>). Both have ‚Äì in my opinion ‚Äì awesome blogs. Not only by content, but also by having very strong online branding. If I ever started my own blog site, I would try to take it to their level. Brent is also a great speaker. I watched some of his sessions ‚Äì despite the DBA content ‚Äì to learn more about speaking. And Thomas because, well ‚Ä¶ bacon of course.</li>
<li>All the other people of the #sqlfamily for making this community so great. You know who you are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">I am absolutely delighted to share the great news that I have been selected as one of the speakers for the 2014 edition of the <a href="http://sqlserverdays.be/">SQL Server Days</a> in Belgium. It is one of the biggest SQL Server events in Europe and this will be the 4th time I am presenting there. A lot of great names of the #sqlfamily have also been confirmed, such as Grant Fritchey, Denny Cherry, Stacia Misner, Klaus¬†Asschenbrenner, Marco Russo, Andr√© Kamman and many many other talented speakers. There are also some great precons, most notably in the BI space the Power BI precon by Jen Stirrup and the SSAS Tabular precon by Julie Koesmarno.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Anyway, my session is titled <em>&#8220;How to (not) torment your fellow SSIS developer?&#8221;</em> and its abstract is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Did you ever inherited a slow running un-maintainable mess of an SSIS package? Or do you want to knock up your SSIS developing skills to the next level?¬†</em><em>This session will guide you through common SSIS best practices and performance pitfalls. We will make packages easier to read, maintain and more efficient.</em></p>
<p><em>You will learn some practical tips to make your life ‚Äì and that of your successor ‚Äì easier.</em></p>
<p>It is a level 300 session, meaning that I will not explain how SSIS works and I will dive straight into some best practices and performance tuning, assuming the audience can tell a control flow and a data flow apart from each other. Basically this session will explain how an SSIS package should look like and behave, at least in my opinion. In other words, if I inherit a package from someone else what stops me from pulling out my hair <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So if you want to learn more about SSIS or if you want to watch other great sessions (5 different tracks with each 5 slots!), do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/registration/">register</a>! There is an early bird discount until the July 15th.</p>

<div class="image_block"><a href="http://wendyverse.blogspot.be/2013/05/its-time-for-t-sqltuesday-42-long-and.html" target="_blank"><img style="float: left;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/TSQL2sday37/TSQL2sday.PNG?mtime=1355209029" alt="" width="133" height="134" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It‚Äôs the second Tuesday of the month, which means it‚Äôs time again for #TSQL2sday! It is the 42<sup>nd</sup> installment of this blog post series and the subject is not about the <em>Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything</em> as I hoped it would be, but about <a href="http://wendyverse.blogspot.be/2013/05/its-time-for-t-sqltuesday-42-long-and.html">the long and winding road</a> that is our work life and which technologies were key to our interests and successes. In this blog post I‚Äôll talk about how I got where I am now and how SSIS played a major role in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About exactly 4 years ago I suddenly found myself out of a job during the financial crisis. I was an IT consultant with no specialization and little experience. Luckily I quickly found a new job through one of my ex-colleagues (always maintain your network people!) at a local BI consulting firm. I didn‚Äôt know a thing about Business Intelligence (I had a bit of data mining and data warehousing in a course at university, but I can‚Äôt really say it sticked), but fortunately the company was willing to invest in junior people. This is a really amazing thing to do, especially in times of crisis and I‚Äôm very grateful for the opportunity they gave me. So the first thing they did was sending me to a couple of Microsoft trainings. I followed one on Analysis Services and I was really amazed by the product. I took another one about Integration Services and I was ‚Ä¶ not so amazed. I don‚Äôt really recall why, but the product just didn‚Äôt strike a chord with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few weeks later I was on my first BI project and my first assignment was: make some SSIS packages. I dreaded the task, but trying to make the most of it I dove into SSIS. And after I made my hands dirty with it and got over the initial learning curve, I suddenly fell in love with SSIS! I saw the possibilities the product has to offer and what amazing stuff you can do with it and I lost all the prejudices I had earlier. After some time I really wanted to expand my knowledge on SSIS, so I had the idea of answering questions about SSIS on forums. Because you learn the most about a subject by ‚Äúteaching‚Äù it. By chance I noticed the SQLServerCentral newsletter in one of my colleagues‚Äô inbox, so I thought: ‚ÄúWhy not that forum? Let‚Äôs try it out.‚Äù I went to SSC, registered myself and started answering questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward a few years. I switched jobs in the meantime but still work quite a lot with SSIS. Thanks to my involvement in SSC, I got to learn a lot of interesting people in the SQL Server community. I started giving sessions at conferences about SSIS, writing articles about it, giving trainings about it and as of late, writing blog posts about it. In a way, my passion for SSIS made me what I am today (in a professional way I mean). I still love SSIS and I like very much what Microsoft did with it in SQL Server 2012, but recently I‚Äôm realizing writing ETL isn‚Äôt the only thing that matters. I‚Äôm slowly diving into the front-end of the BI solution, which is very interesting to work with. Right now I‚Äôm learning more and more about SharePoint BI ‚Äì PowerPivot and Power View ‚Äì and my focus of blog posts is shifting in that direction. My next session I will give at an event will not be about SSIS, but about data visualization. In other words, I might be in yet another bend in the long and winding road that is my career in business intelligence. I‚Äôm very curious to what the future will bring‚Ä¶</p>
