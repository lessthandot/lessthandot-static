				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your processor does not support Virtualization Technology then you can&#8217;t run <a href="/index.php/DesktopDev/MSTech/MSAccess/AccessFormsReports/windows-8-developer-preview-with">Windows 8</a> in Virtual Box&#8230;.you will get a black screen of death. In order to find out if your CPU supports hardware Virtualization Technology you can download the Intel Processor Identification Utility here http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/processors/toolspiu/</p>
<p>Run it and look if Virtualization Technology is enabled&#8230;see the bottom of this picture<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/6145566403/" title="Intel Processor Identification Utility by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6195/6145566403_c707fd4f42.jpg" width="500" height="167" alt="Intel Processor Identification Utility" /></a></p>
<p>if it is enabled then you need to turn it on in your BIOS, to see how to configure BIOS, go to this page  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx</p>
<p>After BIOS has been configured, you need to do a reboot, shut down, wait about 10 seconds and then start up again.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to make the changes in Virtual Box<br />
Click on settings, then system and then on the motherboard tab, click on <strong>Enable IO APIC</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/6145566429/" title="Enable IO APIC by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6145566429_ddb2552029.jpg" width="500" height="218" alt="Enable IO APIC" /></a></p>
<p>On the Processor tab, click on <strong>Enable PAE/NX</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/6145566459/" title="Enable PAE_NX by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6145566459_b3eeb5a675.jpg" width="500" height="139" alt="Enable PAE_NX" /></a></p>
<p>Finally on the Acceleration tab, click on both <strong>Enable VT-x/Amd-v</strong> and <strong>Enable Nesting Paging</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/6146115850/" title="EnableVT by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6180/6146115850_f53b27c536.jpg" width="500" height="130" alt="EnableVT" /></a></p>
<p>Now you are all set&#8230;have fun</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/6145467215/" title="windows 8 metro start screen by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6145467215_0efbb953d9.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="windows 8 metro start screen" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oracle has updated the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/038563.pdf">Sun Acquisition FAQ</a>. The FAQ now has Oracle&#8217;s plans for MySQL, Java, Virtualization, NetBeans, Glassfish, OpenOffice, Open Source and other things.</p>
<p>Below are the relevant pieces from that document.</p>
<p><strong>What are Oracle’s plans for the GlassFish Enterprise (Java<br />
EE) Server after the transaction closes?</strong><br />
Oracle plans to continue evolving GlassFish Enterprise Server, delivering<br />
it as the open source reference implementation (RI) of the Java Enterprise<br />
Edition (Java EE) specifications, and actively supporting the large GlassFish<br />
community.  Additionally, Oracle plans to invest in aligning common<br />
infrastructure components and innovations from Oracle WebLogic Server<br />
and GlassFish Enterprise Server to benefit both Oracle WebLogic Server and<br />
GlassFish Enterprise Server customers.</p>
<p><strong>What are Oracle’s plans for NetBeans?</strong><br />
Oracle has a strong track record of demonstrating commitment to choice for<br />
Java developers. As such, NetBeans is expected to provide an additional open<br />
source option and complement to the two free tools Oracle already offers for<br />
enterprise Java development: Oracle JDeveloper and Oracle Enterprise Pack for<br />
Eclipse. While Oracle JDeveloper remains Oracle’s strategic development tool<br />
for the broad portfolio of Oracle Fusion Middleware products and for Oracle’s<br />
next generation of enterprise applications, developers will be able to use<br />
whichever free tool they are most comfortable with for pure Java and Java EE<br />
development:  JDeveloper, Enterprise Pack for Eclipse, or NetBeans. </p>
<p><strong>What are Oracle’s plans for MySQL?</strong><br />
Oracle plans to spend more money developing MySQL than Sun does now.<br />
Oracle expects to continue to develop and provide the open source MySQL<br />
database after the transaction closes. Oracle plans to add MySQL to Oracle’s<br />
existing suite of database products, which already includes Berkeley DB, an<br />
open source database. Oracle also currently offers InnoDB, an open source<br />
transactional storage engine and the most important and popular transaction<br />
engine under MySQL. Oracle already distributes MySQL as part of our<br />
Enterprise Linux offering.</p>
<p><strong>What is Oracle’s plan for OpenOffice?</strong><br />
Oracle has a history of developing complete, integrated, and open products,<br />
making integration quicker and less costly for our customers. Based on the<br />
open ODF standard, OpenOffice is expected to create a compelling desktop<br />
integration bridge for our enterprise customers and offers consumers another<br />
choice on the desktop. After the transaction closes, Oracle plans to continue<br />
developing and supporting OpenOffice as open source. As before, some of<br />
the larger customers will ask for extra assurances, support, and enterprise<br />
tools. For these customers we expect to offer a typical commercial license<br />
option.</p>
<p><strong>How does Oracle support open source?</strong><br />
Oracle has long been committed to developing, supporting, and promoting<br />
open source. Oracle has been, and continues to be, committed to offering<br />
choice, flexibility, and a lower cost of computing for end users. Oracle<br />
has invested significant resources in developing, testing, optimizing and<br />
supporting open source technologies such as Linux, PHP, Apache, Eclipse,<br />
Berkeley DB, and InnoDB. Oracle continues to embrace and offer open source<br />
solutions as a viable choice for development and deployment. More information<br />
about Oracle’s support of open source can be found at<br />
oracle.com/opensource. </p>
<p><strong>Will Oracle continue Sun’s virtualization strategy?</strong><br />
Yes, Oracle plans to continue Sun’s “desktop to datacenter virtualization”<br />
strategy and integrate with Oracle’s virtualization products. By unifying<br />
management across desktop virtualization, server virtualization, storage<br />
virtualization, and network virtualization, Oracle and Sun provide<br />
comprehensive, flexible, eco-efficient solutions to maximize utilization,<br />
consolidate to reduce costs, increase productivity, and decrease management<br />
complexity. We expect to continue Sun’s desktop virtualization products:<br />
VDI, Secure Global Desktop, Sun Ray, and VirtualBox.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering increased investment and innovation in Java</strong><br />
Oracle plans to accelerate investment in the Java platform for the<br />
benefit of customers and the Java community. Java is one of the<br />
computer industry’s best-known brands and the Java platform is<br />
one of the industry’s most widely deployed technologies. Oracle has<br />
been a leader in the Java community since the inception of the Java<br />
programming language and already has the world’s largest investment<br />
in the Java platform, which provides the foundation for its Oracle<br />
Fusion Middleware products and its next-generation enterprise<br />
applications.<br />
Oracle plans to not only broaden and accelerate its own investment in the<br />
Java platform, but also plans to increase the commitment to the community<br />
that helps make Java an ubiquitous, innovative platform unified around<br />
open standards. </p>
<p>So what do you think, is there still a reason to fear what will happen to these technologies after this deal closes?</p>
