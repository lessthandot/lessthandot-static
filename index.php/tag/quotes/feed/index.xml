<ul>
<li>Rome did not create a great empire by having meetings, they did it by killing all those who opposed them.</li>

<li>Doing a job RIGHT the first time gets the job done. Doing the job WRONG fourteen times gives you job security. </li>
<li>Eagles may soar, but weasels don&#8217;t get sucked into jet engines. </li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence is no match for Natural Stupidity </li>
<li>A person who smiles in the face of adversity&#8230; probably has a scapegoat. </li>
<li>Plagiarism saves time. </li>
<li>If at first you don&#8217;t succeed, try management. </li>
<li>Never put off until tomorrow what you can avoid altogether. </li>
<li>TEAMWORK&#8230; means never having to take all the blame yourself. </li>
<li>The beatings will continue until morale improves. </li>
<li>Never underestimate the power of very stupid people in large groups. </li>
<li>We waste time, so you don&#8217;t have to. </li>
<li>Hang in there, retirement is only thirty years away! </li>
<li>Go the extra mile. It makes your boss look like an incompetent slacker. </li>
<li>A snooze button is a poor substitute for no alarm clock at all. </li>
<li>When the going gets tough, the tough take a coffee break. </li>
<li>INDECISION is the key to FLEXIBILITY. </li>
