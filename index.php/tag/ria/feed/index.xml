				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately we&#8217;ve been playing around with RIA services for Silverlight. Using them we lose the use of our stack, but the speed of development with them is quite impressive. </p>
<h2>Watch and Learn</h2>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with RIA in Silverlight, I would recommend this video: <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/videos/all/net-ria-services-intro/">http://www.silverlight.net/learn/videos/all/net-ria-services-intro/</a>. It is a complete walk through of creating a demo from the &#8216;Business Application&#8217; template in Visual Studio for SL 3. If you are working in SL4, be sure to check the comments in the video for the breaking changes.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Skinny?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty fancy stuff. You make an Entity Framework model, based on your database. Then when you compile, the template generates a whole bunch of code for you. First, on the server it generates a Service and a Metadata class to expose your data entities and basic CRUD functionality to the client. Then in the client, another class is generated that handles the serialization and exposing of those server classes client side. One of the most impressive things about this interaction though, is that the return objects from the server are IQueriable, not arrays. Which gives you the ability to perform LINQ and deferred execution from the client!</p>
<h2>So Why the Fuss?</h2>
<p>Watch the video, play around with it. I&#8217;m not going to go through the whole thing here, but I will show you something I ran into.</p>
<p>I have a relational database, in this case I am looking at the <em>League</em> and <em>Player</em> tables. <em>League</em> has an OwnerPlayer_ID field that links to the <em>Player</em> table. The problem though, by using the RIA services and bindings out of the box, is that while the League class has a .Player property, it will never be populated. And showing people that a League is owned by Player #5237 isn&#8217;t nearly as helpful as showing them the Player&#8217;s name. We have to make 2 changes to get this to work correctly.</p>
<h2>Reprimanding that Lazy EF</h2>
<p>On the server side, find your service class. It should be called something like &#8216;MyApplicationDomainService1&#8217; and be in the &#8216;Services&#8217; folder by default. In that class look for a method called &#8216;GetMyObjects&#8217; where MyObjects is the collection you are binding to on the client side. It should contain something like &#8216;Return (Me.ObjectContext.MyObjects)&#8217;. Change it to:<br />
<code =VB>Return (Me.ObjectContext.MyObjects.Include("MyChildObject")</code><br />
In my case this was the &#8216;GetLeagues&#8217; method and it contains: &#8216;Return (Me.ObjectContext.Leagues.Include(&#8220;Player&#8221;))&#8217;</p>
<p>This will tell the Entity Framework model that it should Eager Load the .Player property. But before we rejoice and rebuild, wait, there&#8217;s more!</p>
<h2>Getting RIA up off the Couch</h2>
<p>Next up, right next to the DomainService1 file should be a file called MyApplicationDomainService1.metadata. In this file we need to find the class that represents what we are querying (The &#8220;MyObject&#8221; from the previous step). In that class you should see the property you want to load (The &#8220;MyChildObject&#8221; from above). On this property, you want to prepend the &lt;Include()&gt; attribute. This will tell the RIA services that it should include this property in the serialization and transmission of the query results. </p>
<p>In my case of League and Owner Player, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>    Friend NotInheritable Class LeagueMetadata
             
        '...

        &lt;Include()&gt;
        &lt;Display(AutoGenerateField:=False)&gt;
        Public Property Player As Player
        '...
    End Class</pre>
<h2>And the Grid?</h2>
<p>Now that the EF is loading the data we want, and the RIA services are returning the data we want, all we have to do is bind it! And this is the easiest part. It is just like they show in the video, with one minor change. Instead of just binding on the primary object&#8217;s property, we use dot notation to get at the child object&#8217;s property. Shown here as the &#8220;Player.Name&#8221; binding</p>
<pre>&lt;sdk:DataGrid x:Name="grdLeagues" Margin="4,20,4,4" Grid.Row="1" ItemsSource="{Binding ElementName=LeagueDomainDataSource, Path=Data}" AutoGenerateColumns="False"&gt;
    &lt;sdk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Name}" Header="Name" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Player.Name, Mode=OneWay}" Header="Organizer" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Province}" Header="State" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=City}" Header="City" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=LGS}" Header="Game Store" /&gt;
    &lt;/sdk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
&lt;/sdk:DataGrid&gt;</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flash Player 10 has been released, here are the new or enhanced features</p>
<p><strong>3D effects <em>New</em></strong><br />
Create more intuitive, engaging interfaces using built-in support for 3D effects. Get started quickly without being a 3D master by designing in 2D and easily transforming and animating in 3D. Fast, extremely lightweight, and simple-to-use APIs, along with 3D tools in Adobe® Flash® CS4 Professional software, make motion that was previously accessible only to expert users via ActionScript® language or custom third-party libraries available to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Custom filters and effects <em>New</em></strong><br />
Create high-performance, real-time effects for cinematic experiences that quickly engage users. With new Adobe Pixel Bender™, the same technology behind many filters and effects in Adobe After Effects® software, these dynamic and interactive effects can be used both in production with After Effects CS4 and live with Flash Player 10. The Pixel Bender just-in- time (JIT) compiler can also be used to process other types of data, such as sound or mathematical functions, asynchronously in a separate thread.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced text support <em>New</em></strong><br />
Take advantage of a new, flexible text layout engine that brings print-quality publishing to the web, building on more than 25 years of Adobe expertise in typography. Gain more control over text layout using an extensible library of ActionScript 3.0 text components to flow text and sophisticated typographic elements such as ligatures across multiple columns, around inline images, bidirectionally, vertically, or chained together. Create multilingual rich Internet applications (RIAs) using device fonts that can now be anti-aliased, rotated, and styled, or build your own unique text components.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic sound generation <em>New</em></strong><br />
Use enhanced sound APIs to dynamically generate audio and create new types of audio applications such as music mixers and sequencers, real-time audio for games, and even audio visualizers. Work with loaded MP3 audio at a lower level by extracting audio data and supplying it to the sound buffer. Process, filter, and mix audio in real time through the Pixel Bender JIT compiler to extend creative freedom beyond the visual experience.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing API <em>Enhanced</em></strong><br />
Perform runtime drawing more easily with restyleable properties, 3D APIs, and a new way of drawing sophisticated shapes without having to code them line by line. Developers can tweak parts of curves, change styling, replace parts, and use custom filters and effects, delivering improved throughput, creative control, and greater productivity. Enhancements to the Drawing API add the z dimension, real perspective, textured meshes in 3D space, a retained graphics model, read/write rendering, and triangle drawing with UV coordinates, while adding memory and improving performance.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware acceleration <em>Enhanced</em></strong><br />
Use the hardware processing power of the graphics card to paint SWF files into the browser and accelerate compositing calculations of bitmaps, filters, blend modes, and video overlays faster than would be performed in software.</p>
<p><strong>Vector data type <em>New</em></strong><br />
Use the new typed array class for better performance, efficiency, and error checking of data.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Streaming <em>New</em></strong><br />
Show exceptional video with streams that automatically adjust to changing network conditions. Leverage new quality-of-service metrics to provide a better streaming experience.</p>
<p><strong>Speex audio codec <em>New</em></strong><br />
Take advantage of the new, high-fidelity and open source Speex voice codec, which offers a low-latency alternative for voice encoding. Flash Player also supports ADPCM, HE-AAC, MP3, and Nellymoser audio.</p>
<p><strong>File upload and download APIs <em>Enhanced</em></strong><br />
Bring users into the experience by letting them load and save files from your web application. New file reference runtime access allows local processing of data without roundtripping to the server.</p>
<p>The latest version of the Adobe Flash Player is  10.0.12.36<br />
Get it here: http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Corp. today announced the availability of Silverlight 2, one of the industry&#8217;s most comprehensive and powerful solutions for the creation and delivery of applications and media experiences through a Web browser. Silverlight 2 delivers a wide range of new features and tools that enable designers and developers to better collaborate while creating more accessible, more discoverable and more secure user experiences.<br />
Microsoft also announced further support of open source communities by funding advanced Silverlight development capabilities with the Eclipse Foundation’s integrated development environment (IDE) and by providing new controls to developers with the Silverlight Control Pack (SCP) under the Microsoft Permissive License.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We launched Silverlight just over a year ago, and already one in four consumers worldwide has access to a computer with Silverlight already installed,” said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president of the .NET Developer Division at Microsoft. “Silverlight represents a radical improvement in the way developers and designers build applications on the Web. This release will further accelerate our efforts to make Silverlight, Visual Studio and Microsoft Expression Studio the preeminent solutions for the creation and delivery of media and rich Internet application experiences.”<br />
Silverlight adoption continues to grow rapidly, with penetration in some countries approaching 50 percent and a growing ecosystem that includes more than 150 partners and tens of thousands of applications. During the 17 days of the 2008 Olympics Games in Beijing, NBCOlympics.com, powered by Silverlight, had more than 50 million unique visitors, resulting in 1.3 billion page views, 70 million video streams and 600 million minutes of video watched, increasing the average time on the site (from 3 minutes to 27 minutes) and Silverlight market penetration in the U.S. by more than 30 percent. Broadcasters in France (France Televisions SA), the Netherlands (NOS), Russia (Sportbox.ru) and Italy (RAI) also chose Silverlight to deliver Olympics coverage online. In addition, leading companies such as CBS College Sports, Blockbuster Inc., Hard Rock Cafe International Inc., Yahoo! Japan, AOL LLC, Toyota Motor Corp., HSN Inc. and Tencent Inc. are building their next-generation experiences using Silverlight.<br />
“CBS College Sports Network streams more than 20,000 hours of live content annually for our 150-plus college and university official athletic partners, so we demand that our video player environment be both consumer friendly and robust,” said Tom Buffolano, general manager and vice president, Digital Programming and Subscription, CBS Interactive-Sports. “Silverlight was the perfect choice to help develop and power our new, exclusive online collegiate sports experience, as it features the best price and performance of any streaming media solution on the market today. Silverlight also gives us the most flexibility in expanding the product in the future as we develop embeddable players and mobile platforms and explore new advertising integration opportunities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft announced plans to support additional tools for developing Silverlight applications by providing funding to Soyatec, a France-based IT solutions provider and Eclipse Foundation member, to lead a project to integrate advanced Silverlight development capabilities into the Eclipse IDE. Soyatec plans to release the project under the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 on SourceForge and submit it to the Eclipse Foundation as an open Eclipse project.</p>
<p>Microsoft also will release the Silverlight Control Pack and publish on MSDN the technical specification for the Silverlight Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) vocabulary. The SCP, which will augment the powerful built-in control set in Silverlight, will be released under the Microsoft Permissive License, an Open Source Initiative-approved license, and includes controls such as DockPanel, ViewBox, TreeView, Accordion and AutoComplete. The Silverlight XAML vocabulary specification, released under the Open Specification Promise (OSP), will better enable third-party ISVs to create products that can read and write XAML for Silverlight.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of new Silverlight 2 features include the following:</strong></p>
<p>.NET Framework support with a rich base class library. This is a compatible subset of the full .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Powerful built-in controls. These include DataGrid, ListBox, Slider, ScrollViewer, Calendar controls and more.</p>
<p>Advanced skinning and templating support. This makes it easy to customize the look and feel of an application.</p>
<p>Deep zoom. This enables unparalleled interactivity and navigation of ultrahigh resolution imagery.</p>
<p>Comprehensive networking support. Out-of-the-box support allows calling REST, WS*/SOAP, POX, RSS and standard HTTP services, enabling users to create applications that easily integrate with existing back-end systems.</p>
<p>Expanded .NET Framework language support. Unlike other runtimes, Silverlight 2 supports a variety of programming languages, including Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, IronPython and IronRuby, making it easier for developers already familiar with one of these languages to repurpose their existing skill sets.</p>
<p>Advanced content protection. This now includes Silverlight DRM, powered by PlayReady, offering robust content protection for connected Silverlight experiences.</p>
<p>Improved server scalability and expanded advertiser support. This includes new streaming and progressive download capabilities, superior search engine optimization techniques, and next-generation in-stream advertising support.</p>
<p>Vibrant partner ecosystem. Visual Studio Industry Partners such as ComponentOne LLC, Infragistics Inc. and Telerik Inc. are providing products that further enhance developer capabilities when creating Silverlight applications using Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Cross-platform and cross-browser support. This includes support for Mac, Windows and Linux in Firefox, Safari and Windows Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>More information and details about Silverlight 2 are available by reading the Silverlight 2 fact sheet at http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/silverlight/default.mspx.</p>
<p>Silverlight 2 will be available for download on Tuesday, Oct. 14, at http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight. Customers already using a previous version of Silverlight will be automatically upgraded to Silverlight 2.</p>
<p>A technology preview of the Soyatec project is available today at http://www.eclipse4sl.org,/ with a complete version available in second half of 2009.</p>
