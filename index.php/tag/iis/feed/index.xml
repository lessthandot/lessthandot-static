				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has released ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM for Visual Studio 2008 SP1.</p>
<p><em>Note   Because Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 RC share a component of ASP.NET MVC 2, installing the ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM release on a computer where Visual Studio 2010 RC is also installed is not supported.</em></p>
<p><strong>New Features in ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM</strong><br />
The following features are new since the RC release of ASP.NET MVC 2.<br />
Templated Helpers Allow You to Specify Extra View Data<br />
ASP.NET MVC 2 now includes new overloads of the EditorFor and DisplayFor methods. These overloads contain a parameter that accepts an anonymous object that can be used to provide extra view data. The view data provided in this parameter is merged with any existing view data that is passed to the template.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM for Visual Studio 2008 SP1 can be downloaded from the following page: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157074</p>
<p>Make sure to also download and read ASP.NET-MVC-2-RTM-Release-Notes.doc. This document has the release notes and the know issues.</p>
<p>To learn how to upgrade an ASP.NET MVC 1.0 application to ASP.NET MVC 2 in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 visit this link: http://www.asp.net/learn/whitepapers/aspnet-mvc2-upgrade-notes/</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are upgrading from windows xp to windows 7 there is a change in the way you install Internet Information Services. On windows xp you would install IIS from add/remove windows components. This is different in Windows 7; it is very similar how it is done on Vista.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel and click on Programs, on the following screen click on Turn Windows features on or off (see image below)</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS1.PNG?mtime=1357140507"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS1.PNG?mtime=1357140507" width="663" height="120" /></a></div>
<p>
After that, select Internet Information Services and click ok</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS2.PNG?mtime=1357140588"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS2.PNG?mtime=1357140588" width="403" height="190" /></a></div>
<p>
You will be presented with a progress box and when that is done you will probably need to restart you machine.</p>
<p>After you restarted, type http://localhost/ in the address bar of a browser and if IIS was started successfully you should see the message: Internet Information Services is running</p>

		<title>Vulnerability in IIS Could Allow Elevation of Privilege</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is investigating new public reports of a possible vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to gain access to a location that typically requires authentication.</p>
<p>Here is what such an attack looks like (from http://milw0rm.com/exploits/8704)</p>
<blockquote><p>The attacker sends a HTTP GET request to the web server.</p>
<p>         GET /  %c0%af/protected/protected.zip HTTP/1.1<br />
         Translate: f<br />
         Connection: close<br />
         Host: servername</p>
<p>As seen above the URI contains the unicode character &#8216;/&#8217; (%c0%af). This unicode character is<br />
removed in a WebDAV request. „Translate: f“ instructs the web server to handle the request using<br />
WebDAV. Using this malicious URI construct the webserver sends the file located at<br />
„/protected/protected.zip“ back to the attacker without asking for proper authentication.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Mitigating Factors:</strong></p>
<p><strong>File system ACLs are enforced</strong>. This vulnerability bypasses the IIS configuration that specifies which authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. A successful exploit of the vulnerability would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account on file system ACL level. Therefore this vulnerability cannot be used to exceed the level of access granted to the anonymous user account through file system ACLs. The default anonymous user account is configured as the IUSR_&lt;computername&gt; account.</p>
<p><strong>The anonymous user account is denied write access by default</strong>. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny ACE for the default anonymous user account. Unless overridden by the administrator, this deny ACE will be inherited by all children under the default Web site root.</p>
<p><strong>WebDAV is not enabled by default on IIS 6.0</strong>. On Windows Server 2003 systems running IIS 6.0, WebDAV is not enabled in the default configuration. Unless WebDAV has been enabled by an administrator on these systems, the vulnerability is not exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Affected Software</strong><br />
Microsoft Internet Information Services 5.0<br />
Microsoft Internet Information Services 5.1<br />
Microsoft Internet Information Services 6.0</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So yesterday I got a new machine at work. I decided to only install SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 on this box. First I installed Visual Studio 2008, after that I installed Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 and then I installed SQL Server 2008. I still remember when I tried to install SQL Server 2008 RTM on my older machine with Visual Studio 2008 and it wouldn&#8217;t do it because you needed SP1 for the framework first, this got released 2 days later or so.</p>
<p>So then I noticed that IIS was not installed on this box, of course you need the CD/DVD to add components to the Operating System. I went to MSDN, downloaded the Operating System, installed IIS and thought I was in business.</p>
<p>Do you see the problem yet?</p>
<p>I loaded up the website that runs on my machine and got the following message</p>
<p><strong>Failed to access IIS metabase</strong></p>
<p>Failed to access IIS metabase? What is that? Since I am lucky that I work with this Ukranian ASP.NET expert he told me to paste the following into the Run command from the Start menu</p>
<p><strong>%windir%Microsoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727aspnet_regiis.exe -i</strong></p>
<p>The version (v2.0.50727) might be different on your machine, it worked like a charm on mine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s say you get 1000 hits per second on your website&#8217;s home page, you want the users to feel that the site is as real time as possible without overloading your database. These hits on your site display some data from the database and are mostly reads; for every 10 reads there is one write. </p>
<p>Yes you can cache it for 1 minute and the database won&#8217;t be hit that much. By doing this it will look like your site doesn&#8217;t update so often. Now what will happen if you do a 1 second cache? You will eliminate most of the reads and your site will still look like it is updating real time. If a user hits F5/CTRL + R every couple of seconds he will see new content. Does this make sense? I am interested in your opinion.</p>
<p>[edit]I am talking about database results caching here. For example take a page like the new submission page on digg,  a lot of stuff gets submitted every second, a lot more gets read of course. If you cache this for one second you eliminate a lot of the reads[/edit]</p>
