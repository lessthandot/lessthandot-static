SQLChow (<a href="http://sqlchow.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/SqlChow">twitter</a>) has the honour to host this jubilee edition of the world famous blog party. The theme of this month is the utterly DBA-related topic of <i>Automation</i>. However, it is pretty easy to give it a BI spin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even we measly BI developers can automate some parts of the development. I’m talking about BIML, a metadata driven markup language (XML for the people that like acronyms) that can generate SSIS packages like you’ve never seen before. BIML is developed by the nice people at <a href="http://www.varigence.com/">Varigence</a> and an open-source implementation is available in the widely popular Visual Studio add-in <a href="http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/">BIDS Helper</a>, which you can download for free at Codeplex. This post will not explain what BIDS exactly is and how it works; I already did that in an article series at MSSQLTips.com. You can find those <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3094/introduction-to-business-intelligence-markup-language-biml-for-ssis/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3115/using-biml-to-generate-an-ssis-import-package/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3124/generate-multiple-ssis-packages-using-biml-and-metadata/">here</a>. Make sure you also check the very excellent resources I link to at the bottom of the articles. The key point you need to remember is that you can use metadata (data about how and where your data is stored) and some scripting with .NET and XML to generate SSIS packages on the fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The only way a solution with BIDS can work is that you have a lot of the same (see how I referred to the title? Extra bonus points.) Developing a BIML script to generate a single package is just plain crazy. It is much easier to do this directly in BIDS (SSDT/SSDTBI) instead of meddling with those XML tags. However, if you can generate a whole bunch of packages in one single click – for example 20 packages importing flat files or 15 packages doing incremental loads for dimensions – you just saved yourself a whole bunch of time. And that’s where the strength of BIML lies. Take a look at your projects and your SSIS packages and see if you can recognize patterns between them. I bet you can find some. These are opportunities to save a bunch of tedious development effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To give an example: in my current project, I created a few packages that all do the same thing: read from the source, calculate a hash value, do a lookup on the destination table and determine if a row is an insert or an update (using the hash value). Inserts are directly sent to the destination table, updates are sent to a staging table. Using this staging table a set-based update is issued against the destination table. Finally a SQL statement checks if rows from the destination table are missing in the source (deletes) and a delete flag is marked for those rows. This pattern was exactly the same for each package. Due to time constraints I couldn’t develop a BIML script because it would take me the same amount of time to develop those packages by hand (about 2 days) and there was a hard deadline. However, I will see if I can find time in the following weeks to develop a BIML script anyway, because I know sources will be added in the future. And when they do, I just need to fill in some metadata in a table and the package will be generated with a simple click. This will potentially saves days of work, and I can always take the script to other projects where similar patterns are needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">So BI developers, what are you waiting for? Automate!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A week ago I gave a session for the Belgian SQL Server user group, <a href="http://sqlug.be/">SQLUG.be</a>, about how MSBUILD can be used to automate SSRS deployments. Thanks to a lovely strike of the taxi drivers in Brussels it took me only 2 hours to get at the location, but hey, the turnout was great, there was beer and pizza and the demo’s didn’t crash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify;">You can find the demo material from my session <a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/SQLUG_MSBUILD/MSBUILD_SSRSDeploy_Demos.zip?mtime=1360009782" target="_blank">here</a> and you can download the slides from </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/KoenVerbeeck/sqlug-msbuild-ssrs-deployments">SlideShare</a><span style="text-align: justify;">. My colleague Valentino did a session as well, you can find his material on his </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://blog.hoegaerden.be/2013/01/30/automating-ssrs-deployment-download/">blog</a><span style="text-align: justify;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For everyone who attended: thanks for joining us and for being such a great audience!</p>

<div class="image_block"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/logo.png?mtime=1358861145"><img style="float: left;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/logo.png?mtime=1358861145" alt="" width="148" height="91" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next Tuesday – 29 januari 2013 – my colleague Valentino (<a href="http://blog.hoegaerden.be/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ValentinoV42">twitter</a>) and I will give two sessions on the topic of Reporting Services deployments at the Belgian SQL Server User Group. In contrast with SSIS and SSAS, there isn’t much available to automate this, so we’ll be spending some time exploring how this gap can be crossed. Each of us will present a different method. Mine is about MSBUILD, an idea presented to my Jamie Thomson (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jamie_thomson/default.aspx">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiet">twitter</a>), who pointed me to one of his blog posts: <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jamie_thomson/archive/2009/10/31/deploying-reporting-services-reports-using-msbuild.aspx">Deploying Reporting Services reports using msbuild</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the official abstracts:</p>
<p><em>You have just finished your dazzling SSRS report project and you can&#8217;t wait to show your visual cleverness to the users. But, the DBA hasn&#8217;t given you permission to directly deploy to the production server! Instead, this paranoia person asked you to deliver him deployment scripts! What are you supposed to do? In the following two sessions, Valentino and Koen will show you two different methods to get the job done.</em></p>
<p><strong>Automating SSRS deployment using built-in SQL Server tools </strong></p>
<p>Have you always wanted to find out what the RS Utility is all about but never dared to ask? Then this session is what you&#8217;ve been waiting for!</p>
<p>Join Valentino to discover how rs.exe can be used to automate SSRS report deployment!</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: </strong>Valentino Vranken<br /> <strong>Level: </strong>300<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Leveraging MSBUILD to automate SSRS deployments. </strong></p>
<p>Unlike SSIS and SSAS, Reporting Services doesn&#8217;t have an easy way to automate deployments. You can work your way around with VBScripts, but isn&#8217;t there an alternative?</p>
<p>Yes there is! Koen Verbeeck will show you in this session how the MSBUILD platform can be used to deploy your SSRS projects to the server.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: </strong>Koen Verbeeck<br /> <strong>Level: </strong>300</p>
<p>All of this goodness will take place in the Ordina Belgium offices. Catering will be provided. This hasn’t been confirmed yet, but it might be pizza and beer <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I will put my slides and demo material online after the session.</p>
<p>More information and registration (there’s still room left) on the <a href="http://sqlug.be/nextevent/event/?id=34">SQLUG.be website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It has been confirmed there will be pizza! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
