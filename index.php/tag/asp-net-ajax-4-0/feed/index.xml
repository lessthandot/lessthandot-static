				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Channel 9 has a bunch of videos showing all the new stuff in Visual Studio 2010. Below is a list of the videos and a little blurb telling you what the video is about.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-1-Working-with-the-Visual-Studio-2010-CTP-VPC/">Episode 1: Working with the Visual Studio 2010 CTP VPC</a></strong><br />
we’ll look at how to download and use the Virtual PC image of the Visual Studio 2010 September CTP. We’ll give you tips on how to download this massive (7GB+ compressed) VPC, show you how to get past some pesky expiration issues, and get you started with the CTP walkthroughs</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-2-Welcome-to-Visual-Studio-2010/">Episode 2: Welcome to Visual Studio 2010</a></strong><br />
we’ll take a very high-level look at Visual Studio 2010. We’ll discuss what types of features you can expect to see in Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0 depending on what type of developer you are. And lastly we’ll go ahead and dive into a revised area of Visual Studio: the Start Page. The Start Page in Visual Studio 2010 has been revised to be XAML-based and allows full customization.<br />
<strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-3-ASPNET-WebForms-40/">Episode 3: ASP.NET WebForms 4.0</a></strong><br />
We’ll begin seeing how Visual Studio 10 and the .NET Framework 4.0 offer compelling new functionality for web developers. In this episode we’ll be specifically focusing on ASP.NET WebForms 4.0, and what enhancements it offers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-4-No-More-Parallel-Development-Pain/">Episode 4: No More Parallel Development Pain</a></strong><br />
We&#8217;ll examine how the improvements to branching and merging in Team Foundation Server 2010 will help eliminate the pain associated with parallel development.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-5-Code-Focused-in-Visual-Studio-2010/">Episode 5: Code Focused in Visual Studio 2010</a></strong><br />
We look at the new code editor in Visual Studio 2010. We&#8217;ll try out some of the new code navigation features that make it easier to move around in your source code.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-6-Parallel-Extensions/">Episode 6: Parallel Extensions</a></strong><br />
we start taking a look at Parallel Extensions to the .NET Framework. We&#8217;ll look at some of the surface-area of the Parallel Extensions API and provide you with enough information to start working with it yourself in the Visual Studio 2010 CTP VPC</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-7-No-More-Planning-Black-Box/">Episode 7: No More Planning Black Box</a></strong><br />
We look at how Team Foundation Server 2010 will help you more easily plan the work and iterations which make up your project. We&#8217;ll first examine the new work item hierarchy which supports such relationships as parent/child and successor/predecessor.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-8-ASPNET-AJAX-40/">Episode 8: Pure Client-Side Development with ASP.NET AJAX 4.0</a></strong><br />
We introduce some of the new features and functionality of ASP.NET AJAX 4.0. We’ll see how ASP.NET AJAX can be leveraged in a complete client-side environment, making it easier to develop rich web applications.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-9-Visual-Basic-10/">Episode 9: Visual Basic 10</a></strong><br />
We introduce some of the new features and functionality coming to the Visual Basic language with the release of Visual Basic 10. We&#8217;ll cover a whole range of features from Auto-Properties, to Multiline Lambdas, Statement Lambdas, Collection Initializers, Array Literals, and Implicit Line Continuation</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-10-Making-Web-Deployment-Easier/">Episode 10: Making Web Deployment Easier</a></strong><br />
n this episode of 10-4, we&#8217;ll look at new features coming in Visual Studio 2010 that make deploying web applications a lot easier. We&#8217;ll look at web.config transformations, the Microsoft web deployment tool and web one-click deployment.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-11-Bi-Directional-Routing-with-ASPNET-WebForms-40/">Episode 11: Bi-Directional Routing with ASP.NET WebForms 4.0</a></strong><br />
We introduce another new feature of ASP.NET WebForms 4.0: Routing. The ASP.NET Routing engine was added in the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 release and is heavily leveraged by both ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Dynamic Data to provide bi-directional routing functionality. With the release of ASP.NET WebForms 4.0, you can take full advantage of the common route engine that allows you to customize the URLs that your application exposes. In addition, new expression builders allow you to generate dynamic URLs that are based on your route definitions, alleviating you from having to hard code static links.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-12-Simplifying-Your-Code-With-C-40/">Episode 12: Simplifying Your Code With C# 4.0</a></strong><br />
We take a look at some features coming with C# 4.0 that will help you simplify your existing code (as well as making new code you write more simple). There&#8217;s already a plethora of C# 4.0 content you can find out there (including here on Channel 9 itself), so we will dive in specifically to how the combination of named and optional parameters will help you simplify your code.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-13-No-More-Late-Surprises/">Episode 13: No More Late Surprises</a></strong><br />
We will take a look at how Team Foundation Server 2010 will enable you to more easily generate dynamic reports that can give you quick insights into how your project is running. In just a few minutes you can create your query and use Microsoft Excel to quickly create a set of graphical reports based on your query. You can even save these reports and publish them to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server for easy access by the rest of the team.</p>
<p>This video is based on the September 2008 CTP, and there will be even more reporting features coming in the upcoming beta release of Visual Studio Team System 2010.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-14-Sentient-DSLs/">Episode 14: Sentient DSLs</a></strong><br />
We introduce a new feature coming along with Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0: sentient DSLs. If you&#8217;ve become intrigued with all the hype around leveraging domain-specific languages, but you&#8217;re concerned about the added complexity that comes with having to learn a bunch of different grammars, then sentient DSLs are for you. Write the code that you think makes sense, and allow the application to create itself. Coding should be fun, and most importantly, it should be easy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-15-Model-First-Development-with-the-Entity-Framework-40/">Episode 15: Model-First Development with the Entity Framework 4.0</a></strong><br />
In this episode of 10-4, we introduce a new tooling enhancement coming with Visual Studio 2010 and the Entity Framework 4.0: model-first development. This feature allows you to create your Entity Data Model from scratch and then generate a database from it, as opposed to reverse engineering your EDM from an existing database.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-16-Windows-Workflow-4/">Episode 16: Windows Workflow 4</a></strong><br />
In this episode of 10-4 we build a &#8220;Hello Workflow 4&#8221; application.  You might have heard that .NET 4 includes an all new Workflow engine &#8211; learn how you can not only use Workflow but also do test first style development with it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-17-F-Intro/">Episode 17: F# Intro</a></strong><br />
In this episode of 10-4, we take a quick look at F#, a new addition to the family of managed programming languages in Visual Studio 2010. F# is a multi-paradigm programming language. Though its focus is at functional programming, it&#8217;s capable of producing object-oriented code like other .NET languages. Since it is a .NET language, it can interop just fine with other existing .NET languages. </p>
<p>There is a lot to F#, more than we could possibly cover in a single 10-4 episode. So in this episode, we are just taking a brief look at the basic data types in F# as well as some more intermediate features like recursion, pattern matching, and partially-applied functions.</p>
<p>For people wanting to following along with this episode, you can grab the latest F# CTP directly from the F# MSDN Dev Center:<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fsharp/default.aspx</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-18-Functional-UI-Testing/">Episode 18: Functional UI Testing</a></strong><br />
In this episode of 10-4 we look at a new type of test coming in Visual Studio Team System 2010 known as the coded UI test. Coded UI tests can be created to automatically navigate through your application&#8217;s UI, which in turn can be used to verify that the paths your users might take through your application are working properly. You can also add validation logic along the way to verify the properties of objects within the UI. Much like unit tests can quickly surface regressions on a method or function level, coded UI tests can bring the same level of rapid automated testing capabilities to the UI layer.</p>
<p>This demo is based on an early build of Visual Studio Team System 2010 Beta 1.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-episode-19-Service-Discovery-with-WCF/">Episode 19: Service Discovery with WCF</a></strong><br />
WCF in .NET 4 includes an implementation of the WS-Discovery protocol.  Sounds exciting right?  Actually it is very cool because it allows you to build applications and services that can discover other services using UDP multicast messages or via a discovery proxy.  In this episode I&#8217;ll walk through the Service Discovery lab where we build a messenger style application I call &#8220;ChatWOW&#8221;.  In this lab you will see how to make your service discoverable and how you can discover other services.  Later when Beta 1 is released, you can try it yourself.</p>
<p>Update: The WCF/WF4 Training Kit is now live at http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wcfwf4 so you can try it yourself.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-20-Downloading-and-Installing-Visual-Studio-2010-Beta-1/">Episode 20: Downloading and Installing Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1</a></strong><br />
Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1 is here! In this episode of 10-4, Brian Keller takes us through downloading and installing Visual Studio 2010 Team Suite Beta 1 and Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server Beta 1. This time-compressed video will take you through all of the key things you need to know to get up and running quickly with beta 1.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-21-Web-Tooling-Improvements/">Episode 21: Web Tooling Improvements</a></strong><br />
n this episode of 10-4, Drew Robbins covers some of the new web tooling features in Visual Studio 2010. There is new Code Snippet support for both HTML and JavaScript. In addition, Visual Studio now has a new dynamic JavaScript IntelliSense engine that infers the return type from functions and provides appropriate intellisense. This makes working with JavaScript libraries a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-22-Simplifying-Data-Driven-Web-Applications/">Episode 22: Simplifying Data-Driven Web Applications</a></strong><br />
In this episode of 10-4, we discuss how the development of data-driven web applications has evolved in ASP.NET and how in the .NET Framework 4 it becomes even easier. Whether you&#8217;re working on a new or existing application, getting your UI to light up model-level metadata/validation becomes as simple as a single line of code.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-23-An-Introduction-to-Manual-Testing/">Episode 23: An Introduction to Manual Testing</a></strong><br />
Despite all of the advances in automated testing tools and frameworks over the last decade, manual testing still constitutes the lion&#8217;s share of testing effort within most software development organizations.</p>
<p>This episode of 10-4 will introduce the new capabilities in Visual Studio Team System 2010 for supporting manual testing. You will see how these capabilities will not only help manual testers do their jobs more effectively, but this approach also helps developers by providing detailed diagnostics information about tests when they fail.</p>
