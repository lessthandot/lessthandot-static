		<description><![CDATA[Worm: The First Digital World War by Mark Bowden

Do you still remember  Conficker, also known as Downup, Downadup and Kido? Conficker infected between 9 million and 15 million PCs
Here are just some examples that I pulled down from wikipedia

<p>Do you still remember  <a href="/index.php/SysAdmins/OS/win32-conficker-b-also-known-as-downadup">Conficker, also known as Downup, Downadup and Kido</a>? Conficker infected between 9 million and 15 million PCs<br />
Here are just some examples that I pulled down from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker#Impact_in_Europe">wikipedia</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Intramar, the French Navy computer network, was infected with Conficker on 15 January 2009. The network was subsequently quarantined, forcing aircraft at several airbases to be grounded because their flight plans could not be downloaded.</li>
<li>
The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence reported that some of its major systems and desktops were infected. The virus has spread across administrative offices, NavyStar/N* desktops aboard various Royal Navy warships and Royal Navy submarines, and hospitals across the city of Sheffield reported infection of over 800 computers.</li>
<li>
On 2 February 2009, the Bundeswehr, the unified armed forces of Germany reported that about one hundred of their computers were infected.</li>
<li>
An infection of Manchester City Council&#8217;s IT system caused an estimated £1.5m worth of disruption in February 2009. USB flash drives have since been banned, as this was believed to be the vector for the initial infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802119832/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802119832">Worm: The First Digital World War</a> by Mark Bowden and decided to check it out since I already read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000957/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0142000957">Killing Pablo</a> which was written by Mark Bowden as well</p>
<p>The book is written for people who are not familiar with all the terms that most IT people know. Things like TCP/IP, ports, RPC and buffer overflow are all explained in very simple ways, an IT person might think that this book is too simple for him or her. The part of the book which I found of most interest is the infighting between the members of the <a href="http://www.confickerworkinggroup.org/wiki/">Conficker Cabal</a> (later renamed to the Conficker Working Group). The cluelessness from the US government was interesting as well.</p>
<p>The book takes you through how the Conficker worm started to infect computers to the cat and mouse game that followed between the Conficker creator and the Conficker Cabal. Also covered is a general history of worms and viruses/virii so that you can see that each virus is based on some elements of the previous one.</p>
<p>The book is only 245 pages and it is a very easy read with a nice size font. If you don&#8217;t know anything about Conficker, I think this is a good book to read. If you already know about Conficker and followed it then I don&#8217;t think you will find a lot of new things in this book that have not been discussed before, however I think that this book will still be of interest to you, the Conficker Cabal stuff was the most interesting part to me</p>
<p>In the end I would recommend this book and I think you will enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a cool way to launch the Malicious Software Removal Tool by Microsoft. I was listening to the <a href="http://twit.tv/sn180">Security Now 180: Listener Feedback 58</a> podcast and Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson described a cool way to launch the Malicious Software Removal Tool</p>
<p>Here are both ways<br />
1) Click on Start&#8211;>Run enter MRT and hit enter</p>
<p>2) Right click anywhere on the desktop, then select New&#8211;>Shortcut, type MRT into the edit field, and hit Next and then Finish.  This will create a shortcut to MRT.exe, in this case the shortcut points to %windir%system32MRT.exe. Now you can just click on the shortcut to launch the Malicious Software Removal Tool</p>
<p>This will work on Vista and XP. Pretty cool right? I think everyone should listen to Security Now, If you are not subscribed to it then you should do it right now.</p>
<p>I will create a blogpost next week about all the podcast that I listen to</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got this from Microsoft and decided would be good to share this with you</p>
<p style="line-height:115%"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%">Based on feedback from<br />
MVPs  and other sources, we are concerned about the rise in reported<br />
infections due to the worm Win32/Conficker.B also known as<br />
“Downadup.”  Though systems which have already applied the<br />
out-of-band released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-067.mspx" target="_blank"><span style="color:windowtext">MS08-067</span></a> in October 2008 are protected,<br />
unpatched system users have experienced system lockout and other<br />
problems.  </span></p>
<p style="line-height:115%"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:windowtext">Last week, we released a version of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx" target="_blank"><span style="color:windowtext">Malicious Software Removal tool</span></a> (MSRT) that<br />
can help remove variants of Win32/Conficker and other resources.  Please<br />
share this information in your communities to help address this threat.</span></p>

exploits a vulnerability in the Windows Server service (SVCHOST.EXE) for<br />
Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2008.<br />
While Microsoft addressed this issue in October with Microsoft Security<br />
Bulletin <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-067.mspx" target="_blank">MS08-067</a>,<br />
and Forefront antivirus and OneCare (as well as other vendor’s anit-virus<br />
products) helped protect against infections, many systems that have not been<br />
patched manually through Server Update Services and Microsoft/Windows Update or<br />
through Automatic Updates have recently come under attack by this worm.<br />
Attacked systems may lock out users, disable our update services and block<br />
access to security-related Web sites:</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%">Updated the January version of the MSRT to<br />
detect and remove variants of Win32/Conficker.B.  You can download this<br />
version from the MSRT from either the <a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft<br />

resources can assist you in resolving issues with unpatched, infected systems<br />
and that you can apply <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-067.mspx" target="_blank">MS08-067</a><br />
to any other unpatched systems as soon as possible to avoid this threat.</span></p></p>
