Before we get started, I’d like to say it has been nothing short of a pleasure writing the last two weeks for SQL University.  All of the discussions and topics we a lot of fun to go over and I’m looking forward to hearing from everyone how they were able to use them.  Don’t forget to pass SQL University and the community itself on to the person to your side that may not be aware of them.  Let’s keep building this community together!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the last day of Community Service week for <a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university">SQL University</a>.  Before we get started, I’d like to say it has been nothing short of a pleasure writing the last two weeks for SQL University.  All of the discussions and topics were a lot of fun to go over and I’m looking forward to hearing from everyone how they were able to use them.  Don’t forget to pass SQL University and the community itself on to the person to your side that may not be aware of them.  Let’s keep building this community together!</p>
<p><strong>The last one means, TEST!</strong></p>
<p>Today being our last day of community service week, we’re going to take a quiz.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/quiz.gif" alt="" title="" width="160" height="201" /></div>
<p>Kidding!!!  (I think an apple just whizzed by my head)</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> are up to bat and we have a plethora of them available to us in the community.   Between Jes, Coach LaRock and I authoring community service week, we have covered a ton of community information.  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/meet-the-sql-server-community/">Meet the SQL Server Community! </a>– (6/14) by Jes Borland</li>
<li><a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/sql-community-tech-forums">SQL Server Forums-Helping to Build a Knowledge Base </a>(6/15) by Ted Krueger </li>
<li><a href="http://thomaslarock.com/2010/06/sql-university-community-service-week/">DBA Coach LaRock: Community Service Week </a>(6/16)</li>
<li><a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/sql-community-professional-association-of-sql-server/">SQL Community: Professional Association of SQL Server</a> – (6/17) by Jes Borland</li>
<li><a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/sql-community-blogging">Let’s Blog!</a> &#8211; (6/17) by Ted Krueger</li>
</ul>
<p>You could almost take what we’ve gone over and spend the next 2 years diving into just those topics.  There is one other corner of the community that I find to be exceptional that cannot go without discussion.  That is, the companies that stand behind us. </p>
<p>If you are reading this and have been part of a SQL Saturday, SQL Server User Group, Pod cast or any type of resource that requires funds, you already know exactly how devoted SQL related companies are to supporting the SQL Community.  Quest, Red-Gate, Pragmatic Works, Confio, Idera…the list goes on and on.  These companies all sell products that help us make life easier for a DBA or DB Developer.   As many say, they help us be lazy database administrators.</p>
<p>These companies take the vast amount of resources and pour them into building the community.  </p>
<p>Quest Software is a great example.  Quest has not only been a major sponsor for dozens of SQL events but also spends a great deal of resources on providing things like, &#8220;<a href="http://sqlserver.quest.com/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=291">The pain of the week</a>&#8221; to the community.   <a href="http://sqlserverpedia.com/">SQLServerPedia</a> is a huge resource powered by Quest with Mr. Ozar leading the way.  You could without a doubt spend a month reading, watching and learning from <a href="http://sqlserverpedia.com/">SQLServerPedia</a>. </p>
<p>Red-Gate is another great company supporting the community in a number of ways,  from the <a href="http://www.exceptionaldba.com/">Exceptional DBA of the Year</a> recognition that is going on right now, to the work that Steve Jones (<a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/steve_jones/default.aspx">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/way0utwest">Twitter</a>)and Brad McGehee (<a href="http://www.bradmcgehee.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/bradmcgehee">Twitter</a>) do for the community backed by Red-Gate.  Red-Gate stands behind the community and does a great deal for us all.  And did I mention the SQL Tools rock?</p>
<p>Pragmatic Works is one of my favorite online free resources in the community.  There are so many <a href="http://www.pragmaticworks.com/Resources/webinars/Default.aspx">webinars</a> provided to the community to build on, you could spend another month just watching them to catch up.  Pragmatic Works has an entire <a href="http://www.pragmaticworks.com/Resources/Default.aspx">resource page</a> devoted to the webinars, whitepapers, articles and my personal favorite, the SSIS Cheat Sheet.  Pragmatic Works is a resource that is valued and highly recommended to everyone that touches anything SQL Server related.</p>
<p>I hardly even scratched the surface of these companies&#8217; devotion and support of the SQL Community.   There are dozens of others that I could sit down and praise for everything they do daily.  I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have worked with some of them during SQL Saturdays and User Groups and sat down to talk with them.  If you have a chance to find them at one of these events or meetings, stop by and get to know them.  You will be amazed at just how much they are involved in the community and the passion that comes out for it.  </p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget these resources</strong></p>
<p>Having lunch at your desk today while we talk about all these cool resources we have?  Good!  We can talk about <a href="http://www.sqllunch.com/">SQL Lunch</a>.  SQL Lunch is another resource that is absolutely free and invaluable.   SQL Lunch is composed of the entire world as a location.  There are speakers from all over that take their time out to hold sessions during the lunch hour (in some time zones).  I know I can’t think of a better way to spend my lunch.  And I know if you are a DBA or DB Developer, you are eating at your desk just as often as I do.</p>
<p>SQL Share is another virtual training resource.  SQL Community leaders such as <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/13986/JessicaMoss.aspx">Jessica Moss</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/1379/Jonathan-Kehayias.aspx">Jonathan Kehayias</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/7/Brian-Knight.aspx">Brian Knight</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/18/Andy-Warren.aspx">Andy Warren</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlshare.com/profiles/2626/Grant-Fritchey.aspx">Grant Fritchey</a> and many more are all part of providing this free resource.  These are web casts that focus on SQL Server topics and get right down to it.  They have an amazing talent for making the difficult topics very easy so you pick them up fast and do them the right way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/">Simple-Talk</a>: Do I need to say more?  I spend a lot of time on Simple-Talk.  The amount of knowledge that is held in this resource is almost frightening.  If you sat back and thought of trying to build a knowledge base and author listing like the one on this site, you would think it is impossible.  But it is there and if you don’t use it, you need to start.</p>
<p><strong>Scratched it</strong></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/scratch.gif" alt="" title="" width="250" height="245" align="left" /></div>
<p>Yes, I scratched again.  I’ve only named a handful of places you can find resources to build your knowledge and networking in the SQL Community.  <strong>There is an enormous amount the SQL Community has to offer</strong>.  The homework for everyone is to go out and find people that do not know about the SQL Community and make them aware.  Nothing is ever perfect and everything can build higher and out farther.  The SQL Community has a lot of space to grow and growing with it is the reward we all shall share.</p>
<p>I’ve had a great time doing SQL University the last two weeks.  I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I have.  As with all of the sessions, I welcome your suggestions on making things better for all of us.  If you would, please take the time to fill out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university/">SQL University</a> is one of the greatest concepts I&#8217;ve seen in the SQL Community.  Thanks to Jorge Segarra (<a href="http://sqlchicken.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/SQLChicken">Twitter</a>)for coming up with it and organizing it.  Today we are going to talk about something dear and close to the concept of SQL University.  Blogging!  Blogs are an important part of the concept of SQL University.  With them we can easily bring this wealth of knowledge in the course syllabus format with writers from the SQL Community in a vast geographical range and range of expertise.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/blog.gif" alt="" title="" width="296" height="280" /></div>
<p>Getting your day-to-day experiences and knowledge out to the community can be tough sometimes.  We can share what we know and what we learn with the teams we work in, but the walls of our building keep that from going far.  Blogging removes the wall and much does much more for our personal growth.  </p>
<p>Promoting and sharing blogs doesn’t only bring with it satisfaction of sharing what you’ve learned but also allows you to help everyone in the community so we can all build our knowledge base.</p>
<p><strong>My own personal story of blogging</strong></p>
<p>
I wrote my first blog in November of 2008.  The title was, &#8220;<a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBAdmin/MSSQLServerAdmin/user-to-schema-to-roles-for-controlling-">User to Schema to Roles for controlling security</a>&#8220;.  I won’t lie; I have learned an enormous amount about how to blog since then.  I’ve learned more about writing period!  Writing is an art form and catching the audience’s attention is important when you write your blogs.  The best part of blogging and writing in general is that everyone has their own way of getting the audience’s attention with humor, technical skills and just downright talent.  You hold that talent inside you, but you need to try it to find it and build on it. </p>
<p>In the SQL Community, we have hundreds (if not thousands) of bloggers out there writing daily and providing step-by-step articles that help us learn new things, fix old things and become better DBA’s all around.   So why write your own if the wealth of knowledge exists and is still pouring out of all of these SQL Community members?</p>
<p><i>If it is written already, I don’t need to write it.</i>  <-- Horrible statement! 


<p>The one reason I can give you to not hold back on starting up your own blog and sharing your SQL Server trials is: everyone sees a situation differently and replays that situation to an audience in many different ways.  Your way (yes, yours) can be the way that a hundred people grasp while other perspectives leave them with questions.  That reason alone takes, &#8220;it&#8217;s already done&#8221; and throws it down the truncate statement.  (Haha! SQL nerd humor is awesome!)  </p>
<p><strong>Let people review them</strong></p>
<p>Letting your guard down and sending your drafted blogs to friends and peers in the SQL Community can be hard.  No one likes to be marked by a red pen or be told that the entire blog may need a new direction.  In some cases, technical reviews find errors and mistakes all over the entire process and even directions describing why what you are telling everyone might not be the best way to do it.</p>
<p>A perfect example is a blog on using TRUNCATE_ONLY.   SHRINK and TRUNCATE_ONLY are just bad.  (Paul Randal (<a href="http://sqlskills.com/blogs/paul">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/paulrandal">Twitter</a>) <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/post/backup-log-with-no_log-use-abuse-and-undocumented-trace-flags-to-stop-it.aspx">says so</a>.) Very bad!  Google TRUNCATE_ONLY log and you will find plenty of bad advice, unfortunately.  The use of this option and action is really not a good thing to do on your SQL Servers.  We do see a lot of blogs going out on the topic though, and complete step-by-step instructions on how to do it.  If these blogs were placed under a technical review, the author may have gotten this reply:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Ted, I hate to say it but the blogs needs a lot of help in the technical realm.   Your steps are perfect and solid for anyone to take and get a shrinkfile working.  No doubt about that!  The problem is, you don’t say anything about why shrinkfile is not good and when to use it.  Just says: do it!  I could see how that might lead to a DBA putting a shrinkfile (or database) into a job and running it endlessly.  I would definitely add a description of the action and emergencies where it really is only called on.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I can also honestly say that most of the SQL Community and bloggers we have would be polite and respectful in while doing a review like this.  </p>
<p>While on this topic; thanks to Jes Borland (<a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/grrl_geek">Twitter</a>) for reviewing this blog and adding to it.  </p>
<p><strong>Practice if you are unsure</strong></p>
<p>Are you still unsure about blogging?  Practice a few blogs.  Write them and save them in a lost sea of folders in your Documents.  When you do that, keep your eyes and ears open in the community.  I can pretty much guarantee you that at some point, someone is going to mention the situation you wrote about either happened to them or they need help on it.  Then scramble to get your blog up and give it to them! </p>
<p><strong>Which blogs should I read?</strong></p>
<p>There are leaders in the SQL Community and those leaders all actively blog (and blog a lot).   The list could go on forever if we put them into this lesson, but luckily enough we have PASS to the rescue as always.  PASS collected a list of community bloggers and <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/Community/BlogDirectory.aspx">posted it</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Still not convinced?</strong></p>
<p>Mike Walsh contributes a lot to the SQL Community.  A little while ago Mike spent the time writing a series on blogging.  The blog series starts with a <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2009/12/interview-with-mike-walsh-about-blogging/">video chat session with Brent Ozar</a> on experiences with blogging.  Then the series goes into, &#8220;<a href="http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2009/12/why-should-i-blog/">Why I should blog</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2009/12/how-should-i-blog/">How should I blog</a>&#8221; and the second part of the <a href="http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2009/12/blogging-tips-brent-ozar-mike-walsh-interview/">interview with Brent</a>.  The series is excellent and answers a lot of questions and pumps you up to get into blogging SQL Server and about the community.  If I haven’t convinced you how blogging can be extremely gratifying, Mike will.  </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to attend another SQL University course! Please take the time to fill out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a>.</p>

<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/sqlu_tiny.gif" alt="" title="" width="54" height="60" align="left" /></div>
<p>Welcome to another day of the Community Service week for <a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university">SQL University</a>.  Jes Borland (<a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/grrl_geek">Twitter</a>) wrote an <a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/meet-the-sql-server-community/">excellent class</a> yesterday on the SQL Community and areas that help connect us all.  Today we&#8217;re going to move on into the service parts of the SQL community and show how we can keep building the community.  I’d like to thank Jes again for helping author todays topic on technical forums.  </p>
<p>As with all SQL University weeks, please take a moment to rate us by filling out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a>.  We greatly appreciate your feedback so we can all become better.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re devoting an entire class to technical forums this week.  Forums have been around as long as most of the online community services have been.  They offer (mostly) unsolicited help at (mostly) no charge to the person requesting the help.  The word mostly worked its way into that last statement quite a bit.  There are resources out there that will allow the solicitation of the members and will charge for help.  This class is not going to discuss any of those services.  Why?  Because we are discussing the SQL community and this community truly puts itself out in front of everyone in need without asking for much of anything in return.  The community devotes countless hours to supporting the strong foundation that it has constructed over the years.  Rarely will you find a part of it in which a request for money, goods or payback will be requested or expected.  In most cases, the gratitude of the solution being worked out amongst ourselves is the reward and payback.   The community takes that to heart and it is why you may not find another group like the SQL community.</p>
<p><strong>All bases covered</strong></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/big _circle.gif" alt="" title="" width="645" height="504" /></div>
<p>SQL Server has grown to cover a wide flavor of specialized fields over the last decade.  Business Intelligence, CLR specialists, Tuning Experts, Mud Wrestling administrators, SAN Experts, Broker Experts, Full Text Search Experts, T-SQL Experts…the list goes on and on.  A lot of these experts fit into groups such as the BI group, the SQL Programming group and the DBA group.  In each of these groups you will find leaders that jump at the opportunity to throw what they know out into the public to help with any problems, new development or implementations.  These members of the community often are referred to as answerers.  And even the answerers turn to the others for help in the time of need, so we all become answerers in the community. </p>
<p><strong>The list</strong></p>
<p>How do you find these leaders and others that devote even minutes of their day to helping?</p>
<p>Below is a list of some sites that I, and other authors this semester, visit daily or hourly,  or sometimes lurk at with their finger on the refresh button:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/category/sqlserver/">MSDN SQL Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://serverfault.com/">Serverfault</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/">SQLServerCentral Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlteam.com/forums/">SQL Team Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewforum.php?f=14&amp;sid=95273364bfa1d4cbee1b6a2bf998431b">LessThanDot.com SQL Forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These forums are available for free and are a resource that should not be set to the side lightly.  The members of these forums all have a great deal of unique, real-life experiences to share, and will help in building your own knowledge.   If everyone in the community helps build the forums, the knowledge base that can be composed is truly infinite in nature. </p>
<p><strong>Reward yourself by giving back</strong></p>
<p>When asking questions in forums around the SQL community, there is one way that you will find even more value in the resource.  Start answering the questions and helping others!  No one knows the answer to everything!  What will often happen is that you can assist in searching other resources, testing on your resources that may not be available to the other people asking for help or simply work through the problem and troubleshoot in your unique way.  This builds both sides in learning more about SQL Server and everyone benefits. </p>
<p>Never feel uncomfortable helping others.  Helping is one of the foundations of increasing your knowledge of SQL Server.  Everyone won’t run into the same problem in our careers working on SQL Server, so we may never be exposed to specific situations.  By giving back on these forums and working through issues that you may not have come across, you benefit by learning the situation, path to recovery and complete solution.  Imagine the power behind that knowledge if the same problem comes up in your own environment someday!  So when you ask a question on one of these SQL Server forum resources, think about looking around to see if you might be able to help out and give a little back.  You may just become addicted like many of us have over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Obligation</strong></p>
<p>It is absolutely critical to understand that the members in these forums do not have a binding agreement to help nor are they obligated in any way to stick through it.  Usually, the members helping will go to great lengths to solve the problems.  If a person does not stick through it though, becoming frustrated with them is usually not the best reaction.  The member helping may have had a problem of their own come up, or had to leave their computer for a time.  Every reply is given for free and as-is.  Reacting negatively when a member that is helping you leaves abruptly may cause repercussions in the future, when you have another question. </p>
<p>When every resource fails you: Books Online, real books, your secret cube buddy that knows how to write SELECT *, the help desk solution of reboot doesn’t work &#8211; give the technical forums a try.  When you get an answer and are sitting back relaxing, push the chair back to the keyboard and see if you can return the favor by helping on the next thread under yours.</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/crazy_hair_puller.gif" alt="" title="" width="101" height="160" align="left" /></div>
<p>There is no need to pull your hair out at the roots; no need to call the CTO and tell them you quit before they fire you for not being able to fix it; no need to literally break down.  Give it a try and post your situation on a SQL Server forum.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised at the results you receive.  </p>

<p>Welcome to the last class of HA / DR week for SQL University.  It has been a great week discussing these topics with all of you.  We <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBAdmin/sqlu-taking-a-break-for-recess">recapped</a> those classes in order to highlight the key points over the week yesterday.  So far we&#8217;ve covered a great deal but really have only scratched the surface of SQL Server features for HA and DR.  Today will be another scratch in the surface regarding the High Availability points for SQL Server.  Be sure to check the resources links through this article.  They will greatly add an extension to today and further build your knowledge of the vast amount of abilities we have at our disposal.  </p>
<p>Now that HA / DR week is completed, please take a moment to rate this week (and others) by filling out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/sqlchicken.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDBoSW02QldrTTc2dER3WVZheUlEX3c6MQ#gid=0">SQL University Course Evaluation</a> and select HA/DR Week.  </p>
<h2><strong>What is HA?</strong></h2>
<p>High Availability (HA) for SQL Server can be defined in one sentence: Keep data available 100% of the time.   That really is the objective of HA and nothing short of that.</p>
<p>Realistically, 100% is unachievable given the nature of computing.  There are needs for a SQL Server and Windows Server to be rebooted at least once a year.  This is to allow for updates on both SQL Server and Windows to be maintained.  So the ranking method we use for measuring high availability is the &#8220;nines&#8221; scale.  The five nines is a goal that most database<br />
administrators and teams set for their standards.  The five nines level is a height of availability that is truly an achievement and one to be proud of.  </p>
<p>The table below illustrates the availability calculation.  This table has been used for quite some time and has been adopted by IT teams as the measurement for downtime. Downtime equates to uptime (depends on if you are talking to a CTO, CEO or an IT manager how to phrase it).  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/ha_1.gif" alt="" title="" width="547" height="310" /></div>
<p align="center"><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability">High Availability</a></i>
</p>
<p>The six nines goal is almost unachievable but can be done in some infrastructures.  Why are the six nines almost out of reach?  Given that a reboot on Windows takes a little under 2 minutes, reaching only a 31 seconds downtime goal becomes a bit farfetched.  Even if clustering and mirroring is setup, the failover times still will add up to around 15 seconds per failover.  The five nines is a goal that you can achieve with a mid-level installation and still meet the needs to keep your systems up to date yearly.  </p>
<p>Windows clustering has come a long way over the last few versions.  Windows Server 2008 in particular has a sound clustering service that is more stable than its predecessors (In this author’s opinion).  Windows clustering will give you the ability to automatically failover due to hardware failures and most Operating System failures.  The concept of this ability alone allows the setup to be valuable to HA strategies.  Clustering consists of two or more physical servers.  These physical servers act like a partnership and are always in communication with each other ensuring that their specific roles are being met.  These servers can be in a state of Active or Passive but one must be in a Active state at all times.  </p>
<p>A benefit to Windows Clustering is the storage location of the actual databases.  This would be located on disk (NAS, SAN etc…) outside the physical servers.  Given this, we enhance HA by having the ability to replicate the disk along with the safety of the cluster acting in partnership with DR.  Mirroring can be added to the cluster fully enhancing the entire landscape of the true HA strategy.  Windows Server 2008 Clustering all together is a straight forward setup and deployment but will take added knowledge and research to ensure the cluster is configured to the specifics of each environment.  With any cluster, there is complexity in the configurations and ensuring the two servers stay in sync for programs, hardware and services but administrative tasks are much lighter than they were in the past.  </p>
<h2><strong>Maintenance and downtime </strong></h2>
<p>Downtime can be caused by any type of disruption to the availability of data.  Maintenance tasks like index rebuilding, updates and ETL loads all fall into that category.  When doing large index rebuild tasks, the tables may become unavailable to the users.  In the database view of this, they are simply locked at this time.  This equates to almost complete loss of the ability to access them though and thus, a failure in our HA strategy.  These tasks should be planned out careful to prevent this type of failure in HA.  </p>
<p>Windows and SQL Server updates must be maintained.  This is not optional.  Every update should be analyzed carefully and the full extent of its impact on the systems taken into consideration.  Some updates may cause SQL Server services to stop or other supporting services that are needed to maintain availability.  If they are, the downtime should be planned carefully to prevent the HA landscape from doing its job of preventing loss and availability.  That means pausing mirroring or failing over nodes in a cluster to retain the availability of data services as much as possible.  </p>
<h2><strong>Geo-Clustering </strong></h2>
<p>Geo-Clustering allows us to plan High Availability across geographically located sites.  This is achieved through replication of disk to each site and essentially mirrors each system to the next.  This HA option of high availability as a hefty price tag on hardware and networking abilities.  Recently, Paul Randal (<a href="http://sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/paulrandal">Twitter</a>)published a White paper <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tommills/archive/2010/06/02/new-sql-server-2008-r2-high-availability-whitepaper-published.aspx"><i>Proven SQL Server Architectures for High Availability and Disaster Recovery</i></a>.  This went over HA setups (and DR) that are in use in businesses now and proven to work effectively.  This white paper goes into detail on actual in-place configurations in Geo-Clustering as well.  This class lucks out on the timing of this publication by us being able to link to it as a resource in understanding large business HA and Geo-Clustering.  </p>
<h2><strong>Database Mirroring</strong></h2>
<p>Database mirroring was introduced in SQL Server 2005 Standard and Enterprise editions.  Prior to the introduction of database mirroring, there was difficulty in achieving HA with SQL Server.  Clustering and disk replication were options but still limited.  With database mirroring the options for HA landscapes opens up greatly.  This doubled with the advancements in Windows Clustering added a great deal of enterprise abilities to SQL Server.  </p>
<p>Our landscape for data services can take on a new form for HA and exist without Windows Clustering as well.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/ha_2.gif" alt="" title="" width="405" height="386" /></div>
<p>What this type of HA landscape provides is even more stripped down overhead in administrative burdens and we have cost savings opportunities to assist in providing a HA solution.</p>
<p>In the diagram above, the landscape consists of two physical database servers.  Those database servers a standalone installations and active as each unique entity to the infrastructure.    Alias naming can be added to the scenario to ensure the clients access the database servers in the event of a failover.  Alias naming can be forgone with the changes in recent years to the ability of connections from applications to allow for a failover specification.  </p>
<pre>Data Source=myServerAddress;Failover Partner=myMirrorServerAddress;Initial Catalog=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;</pre>
<p align="center"><i>Resource:  <a href="http://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server-2008">ConnectionStrings.com</a></i></p>
<p>We can see in the example connection string above the Failover parameter which allows us to make applications much smarter as opposed to recent years with actually developing tests in code to determine the availability of data services.  </p>
<p>Another addition is added to the diagram that is provided with Enterprise Edition.  That is snapshots capabilities.  In this landscape (and clustering) a path can exist from another reporting server to snapshots that are taken of the mirror.  This reporting solution is a huge benefit to the entire structure of the data services by lower the activity on the OLTP side.  Reporting activity has always been an historical hardship of database administrators and keeping services for both reports and operations from preventing each other’s ability to serve the business.  </p>
<h2><strong>Working with database mirroring</strong></h2>
<p>To go deeper into database mirroring, we will work from a recent setup located at, <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBAdmin/sql-server-2008-mirroring-setup">Mirroring Hands On with Developer Edition</a>.  In this setup, Developer edition is used to provide all of the possible configurations provided in mirroring.  The setup and purchase of Developer Edition is highly recommended to become familiar with these features.</p>
<p>The primary features we lose when moving to Standard Edition are Asynchronous<br />
Mirroring and Snapshot capabilities of the Mirror.  One important factor of snapshot abilities is, the snapshot cannot occur while the mirroring is in a synchronizing state or applying transactions.  In an asynchronous setup (High performance), depending on the number of transactions, this state can be harder to schedule for snapshot creations.  These two features are a large part of mirroring and the flexibility in configuring it.  Weigh in the needs of mirroring greatly and the loss of these features when not putting the budget in for Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>After going through the developer setup in the link above, we can start to look at options in mirroring and things to watch for.</p>
<h2><strong>Operating Modes</strong></h2>
<p>
Database Mirroring allows for three operating modes.</p>
<ul>
<li>High Availability</li>
<li>High protection</li>
<li>High performance</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to achieve HA with out of the box SQL Server, we enlist in the High Availability operating mode.  This setup runs in a synchronous set of operations that apply transactions to the logs on both the mirror and principal prior to returning success commits back to the applications.  The mirroring landscape consists of three physical servers, the principal, the mirror and the witness.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="MT_red">Note: The witness can be any edition of SQL Server but the principal and mirror must be the same edition.  The principal can be a previous version than the mirror but this is only recommended in upgrade methods.  The witness can be located on the mirror but this is not recommended due to the chance of losing the mirror and thus, losing the witness.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The remaining two operating modes take the witness and automatic failover out of the landscape.  This is not optimal in achieving HA.  Without automation and the active ping in mirroring, the downtime is greater and human interaction is required.</p>
<h2><strong>What can go wrong?</strong></h2>
<p>The worst thing that can happen in database mirroring is losing the network behind it.  This can cause a complete loss of data services.<br />
Another known problem is referred to as Split-brain.  In this situation, both the Principal and Mirror have taken on the role of a principal.  In the landscape in which alias’s are utilized this can be a severe problem to accessing the databases.</p>
<p>Corruption (page errors) that occurs on the Principal will follow to the mirror.  Database mirroring does enlist in <i>automatic page-repair</i>.  This is now available in SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2.  The automated page-repair will attempt to repair any page errors that are sent to the mirror by requesting the transactions (or fresh copy of the pages) again from the principal.  This repair will work in some scenarios but if the corruption is too great and requires any type of loss in data, an error will persist.</p>
<p>When a mirror does receive errors (even if capable of fixing), the mirror goes into a suspended state.  This suspended state will persist until the error is resolved.  If the error cannot be resolved by automation of the mirroring abilities, the mirror will stay in the suspended state.  This usually will cause a clean setup of the mirroring landscape.  In a worst case scenario, the errors that came from the principal are great enough that repairing the principal is the priority. </p>
<p>Transaction log growth must be maintained in mirroring.  Database mirroring requires the databases to be in Full recovery.  This means that the transaction logs must be maintained and sized properly.  If they are not, the logs will grow and at some point the need to shrink them will undoubtedly occur.  These operations are not allowed in a mirror though and the mirror will need to be broken to do them.  It is highly recommended to take all the necessary steps to maintain a full recovery state.  Keep this in mind while performing index maintenance especially.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The combination of Windows Clustering and Database Mirroring will allow for the objective of data services to meet High Availability goals.  With Database Mirroring, we can achieve HA with the operating mode of High Availability while not needing a clustered environment (although recommended).  This landscape lowers cost and allows for flexibility in some applications that may have particular needs outside of the clustering scope.</p>
<p>Achieving High Availability should be seamless to the user community.  Failover situations must be automated in order to retain HA and limited to no exposure to the users at the time a failover is needed.  Working with the applications and vendors to achieve these goals is sometimes required but often fully achievable.</p>

The recess bell just rang for SQL University HA / DR classrooms.  While all of the SQL kiddies are running around the playground and playing with the things they have learned over this semester, the chalkboard is going to get a workout.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/bart.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="339" /></div>
<p align="center"><i>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.addletters.com/pictures/bart-simpson-generator/233605.htm">Bart Simpson Chalkboard Generator</a> and <a href="http://toadworld.com/BLOGS/tabid/67/EntryID/543/Default.aspx">linkback to Jeff Smith excellent article</a></i></p>
<p>
Over the last week we’ve gone over a lot regarding HA and DR.  The first day we defined situations and the key factors that are needed to be successful in obtaining secure data services and high availability of those data services.  Any of these two strategies to protect our data against disasters, local and remote; always start with the definitions required to plan out the implementation.  We learned together that just throwing things like log shipping into the mix may not truly give us the protection we need.  This would happen if we leave important business entities out of our planning and document how our systems would come back from disasters.
</p>
<p>We done this over the week by showing the features that SQL Server has to offer without much added cost.  When budget is available, we also discussed briefly landscapes like Geo-clustering, SAN replication and truly next to real-time mirrored data centers for recovering in the event of disasters.  These were terms in passing so we didn’t venture off the scope of each class but their importance is there nonetheless. </p>
<p>
We defined a list of the important notes we set off to discuss that effect the decisions of how we can accomplish HA and DR</p>
<ol>
<li>Size of databases</li>
<li>Network capabilities</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Features available per edition of SQL Server</li>
<li>Maintenance load</li>
<li>Allowable downtime</li>
<li>Personnel resources required</li>
<li>Initial setup downtime</li>
<li>Will DR fit into the HA strategy?</li>
<li>Documentation – knowledge transfer</li>
<li>Can we test this?</li>
</ol>
<p>Automation of Disaster and Recovery played an important part in our discussions.  Do we automate is the key to decide in your unique strategies.  DR typical is a manual failover process while HA only becomes HA when automation is playing into the events of a localized disaster.</p>
<p>SQL Server backups were stressed on day two as the foundation of all that is DR (and HA recovery).  With careful planning and testing on both HA and DR, we achieve secure and always available data services.  But when even that strategy fails, we must turn to our backups to recover both the data and the DR and HA strategies themselves.  </p>
<p>Today we discussed log shipping as a cost effective disaster and recovery method.  Log shipping is a great alternative when budgets are low.  Problems do arise in the effectiveness when our data services are larger than our check books though.  All-in-all, log shipping can provide security in a DR situation and leaving it as a possibility when strategizing is always good. </p>
<p>So now we move to our last day and we will discuss High Availability.  The class will show database mirroring in our newer versions of SQL Server.  We’ll discuss things like split-brain scenarios in mirroring and certificate usage so we can mirror across different domains.  Finally, we need to briefly discuss SAN replication and geo-clustering again.  Although we will be brief on this topic, we want to emphasize them because when the budget is there, nothing really matches them for real-world HA.</p>
<p><strong>Recess is now over so let’s get back to work!</strong></p>
