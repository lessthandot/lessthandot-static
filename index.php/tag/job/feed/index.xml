<p>So the economy is really bad and your job might be on the line, Google is always looking for new talent. Here are 2 questions that they asked a friend of mine. What would you answer?</p>
<p><em>1. You have been shrunk down to the size of a nickel and tossed into a blender. You are told that the blender blades will start in 60 seconds.What would you do to save your life?</p>
<p>2. Design and describe a system/application that will most efficiently produce a report of the top 1 million Google search requests.These are the particulars.</p>
<p>* You are given 12 servers to work with. They are all dual-processor machines with 4Gb of RAM, 4x400GB hard drives and networked together.(Basically, nothing more than high-end PC&#8217;s)</p>
<p>* The log data has already been cleaned for you. It consists of 100 Billion log lines, broken down into 12 320 GB files of 40-byte search terms per line.</p>
<p>* You can use only custom written applications or available free open-source software.</em></p>
<p>So what do you think, could you answer these questions?</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget, if you have any tech questions then don&#8217;t hesitate to ask in our <a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/">forums</a></p>
