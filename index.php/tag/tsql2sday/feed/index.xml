				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month’s <a href="http://realsqlguy.com/invite-for-tsql2sday-59-my-hero/">T-SQL Tuesday</a> is hosted by Tracy McKibben (<a href="http://realsqlguy.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/RealSQLGuy">twitter</a>) and is all about heroes (not the TV show).</p>
<p><a href="http://realsqlguy.com/invite-for-tsql2sday-59-my-hero/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2241" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TSQL2sday.png" alt="TSQL2sday" width="133" height="134" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ada Lovelace has been an inspiration to many. In keeping with my blog theme, let’s call her a hero. We all have our heroes, those people who we admire, who inspire us, who we strive to be like. Who is your hero?</em></p>
<p><em>Your assignment is to acknowledge, in writing, your hero (or heroes). You don’t have to mention them by name if you’re not comfortable doing so, but you do have to tell us how you met them, how they have inspired you, and what qualities or traits of theirs you have striven to adopt.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I was thinking for the past week about my heroes and I decided to give you a shortlist of SQL Server people who had some influence on me during my BI career.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jamie Thomson (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/jamie_thomson/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiet">twitter</a>) aka SSISJunkie. When I started out with BI and mainly SSIS, his blog taught me a lot about SSIS. I still use his naming conventions every day in my SSIS packages.</li>
<li>Chris Webb (<a href="http://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Technitrain">twitter</a>). He was the first “international” speaker I saw live on a SQL Server conference. He lives and breathes SSAS and his little pinky toe knows more about MDX than I ever will (that isn’t hard to accomplish though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Steve Jones (<a href="http://voiceofthedba.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/way0utwest">twitter</a>), Grant Fritchey (<a href="http://www.scarydba.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GFritchey">twitter</a>), Gail Shaw (<a href="http://sqlinthewild.co.za/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/SQLintheWild">twitter</a>) and Jeff Moden + other regulars at the <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/">SQLServerCentral</a> forums. Their knowledge and untiring effort on the forums still amazes me day after day. Special thanks to Jeff, Jedi of set-based thinking and master of the tally table, for teaching me through his articles how to make my queries a thousand times faster.</li>
<li>Rafal Luckawiecki (<a href="https://projectbotticelli.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaldotnet">twitter</a>) and Buck Woody (<a href="http://buckwoody.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/buckwoody">twitter</a>) because they are such amazing speakers. Their level of expertise in bringing a message across to an audience is what I strive to have someday. If you are on event and one of them are speaking, try the catch a session, you won’t regret it.</li>
<li>Brent Ozar (<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/BrentO">twitter</a>) and Thomas LaRock (<a href="http://thomaslarock.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/SQLRockstar">twitter</a>). Both have – in my opinion – awesome blogs. Not only by content, but also by having very strong online branding. If I ever started my own blog site, I would try to take it to their level. Brent is also a great speaker. I watched some of his sessions – despite the DBA content – to learn more about speaking. And Thomas because, well … bacon of course.</li>
<li>All the other people of the #sqlfamily for making this community so great. You know who you are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>

<p>This month’s T-SQL Tuesday is being hosted by SQLChow (<a href="http://sqlchow.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/sqlchow" target="_blank">t</a>) and the topic is “Automation, how much of it is the same?”.  As SQLChow noted, automation was a topic a few years ago and now it is being revisited to see if and how it has changed over the years.</p>
<p>I know for me, over the last few years, automation has taken a larger role in many of the things I do.  I’ve automated many processes over the years using various tools such as SSIS and PowerShell and doing so has not only saved me time but my sanity as well  One of the biggest areas of automation for me over the past couple of years has been the automation my installs of SQL Server.  Everything from test and production server installs to automating the installation of the SQL Server Client Tools on developers machines and even cluster installs.</p>
<p>I know there are a couple tools out there to help with the automation of SQL Server installs, but my tool of choice has been <a title="SQL Server FineBuild" href="http://sqlserverfinebuild.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">SQL Server FineBuild</a>.  SQL Server FineBuild is a CodePlex project that is freely available and provides a one-click install of SQL Server.  It supports all versions of SQL Server from 2005 through 2014 and is highly customizable.  Not only does it support the installation of SQL Server, it also supports service packs, cumulative updates and hotfixes as well as many 3rd party tools such as BIDS Helper.  SQL Server FinBuild gives you fine grain control over every aspect of your install from the database engine to reporting services, integration services, etc as well as configuration options such as ports, service accounts, database mail and even adding permissions for environment specific accounts or configuring the SQL Client Tools on a developers machine.  This is just a short list of what SQL Server FineBuild can automate.</p>
<p>With SQL Server FineBuild I’ve been able to automate my installs but the benefits haven’t ended there.  If I’ve needed another server setup identical to a current server for testing, it’s very simple to take the configuration file from the original server and use it to build the test server and know that the install will be identical to the original install.  I’ve also used SQL Server FineBuild to update current installs at different patch levels to a consistent patch level across the board.</p>
<p>Automating your installs, as with automating anything, takes some initial setup and testing time, but once complete the benefits out weigh the costs especially if you are doing a lot of installs.  Just automating the SQL Server Client Tools installation can be a large time saver as the install can then be run by almost anyone in support.  Not only that but every developer will be setup the same way and patched to the current level of your environment.</p>
<p>If there is a repeatable process that I have to do over and over, I try my best to automate it and with this tool I’ve been able to not only automate my installs but save time as well.  If you do a lot of installs or simply want a way to quickly reinstall a server in the case of a disaster, I encourage you to look into automating your installs.</p>

SQLChow (<a href="http://sqlchow.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/SqlChow">twitter</a>) has the honour to host this jubilee edition of the world famous blog party. The theme of this month is the utterly DBA-related topic of <i>Automation</i>. However, it is pretty easy to give it a BI spin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even we measly BI developers can automate some parts of the development. I’m talking about BIML, a metadata driven markup language (XML for the people that like acronyms) that can generate SSIS packages like you’ve never seen before. BIML is developed by the nice people at <a href="http://www.varigence.com/">Varigence</a> and an open-source implementation is available in the widely popular Visual Studio add-in <a href="http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/">BIDS Helper</a>, which you can download for free at Codeplex. This post will not explain what BIDS exactly is and how it works; I already did that in an article series at MSSQLTips.com. You can find those <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3094/introduction-to-business-intelligence-markup-language-biml-for-ssis/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3115/using-biml-to-generate-an-ssis-import-package/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3124/generate-multiple-ssis-packages-using-biml-and-metadata/">here</a>. Make sure you also check the very excellent resources I link to at the bottom of the articles. The key point you need to remember is that you can use metadata (data about how and where your data is stored) and some scripting with .NET and XML to generate SSIS packages on the fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The only way a solution with BIDS can work is that you have a lot of the same (see how I referred to the title? Extra bonus points.) Developing a BIML script to generate a single package is just plain crazy. It is much easier to do this directly in BIDS (SSDT/SSDTBI) instead of meddling with those XML tags. However, if you can generate a whole bunch of packages in one single click – for example 20 packages importing flat files or 15 packages doing incremental loads for dimensions – you just saved yourself a whole bunch of time. And that’s where the strength of BIML lies. Take a look at your projects and your SSIS packages and see if you can recognize patterns between them. I bet you can find some. These are opportunities to save a bunch of tedious development effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To give an example: in my current project, I created a few packages that all do the same thing: read from the source, calculate a hash value, do a lookup on the destination table and determine if a row is an insert or an update (using the hash value). Inserts are directly sent to the destination table, updates are sent to a staging table. Using this staging table a set-based update is issued against the destination table. Finally a SQL statement checks if rows from the destination table are missing in the source (deletes) and a delete flag is marked for those rows. This pattern was exactly the same for each package. Due to time constraints I couldn’t develop a BIML script because it would take me the same amount of time to develop those packages by hand (about 2 days) and there was a hard deadline. However, I will see if I can find time in the following weeks to develop a BIML script anyway, because I know sources will be added in the future. And when they do, I just need to fill in some metadata in a table and the package will be generated with a simple click. This will potentially saves days of work, and I can always take the script to other projects where similar patterns are needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">So BI developers, what are you waiting for? Automate!</p>
