<p><span style="font-size: small;">This month&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jasonstrate.com/2012/08/august-meme15-assignment/" target="_blank">#Meme15</a> topic is one that I suggested to Jason State (<a title="Blog" href="http://www.jasonstrate.com/" target="_blank">B</a>|<a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/stratesql">T</a>): What are 5 (or 10) reasons why you like your job?</span></p>
<div class="image_block">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">In the last few months I&#8217;ve seen lots of people changing jobs (both from the SQL Community and from my company) and it got me thinking about where I was at in my career.  At the end of some reflection I came the conclusion that I already knew, I love my job.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">1)  Not pigeonholed. </span></div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">I get to play with and experience many many different aspects of SQL      Server.  I do things from Query Tuning, Maintenance Planning, SSIS,      Cluster Setup, Migrations and Replication.  What I did last week is      likely not what I&#8217;m doing this week.  I even dip into DB2 and Oracle      (but I maintain that I know nothing of either one!).</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">2)  Cutting edge. </span></div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">Within the first 3 months that SQL 2012 was release, I setup 3      clusters and about 30 instances with it.  I also went through SSWUG&#8217;s      SQL 2012 training series and have a nice certificate for completing it.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">3)  SQL Saturdays      and Mad PASS. </span></div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">I may not be able to go to PASS, but I do get to      attend a few SQL Saturdays each year.  If you haven&#8217;t been to a SQL      Saturday or local SQL User Group, GO!  I&#8217;ve learned a ton at these      events both in the sessions and during hallway conversations.  I&#8217;ve      also made some great friends.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">4)  DBA Team. </span></div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones who is part of a DBA Team.  We&#8217;re a      large enough company that we actually have 6 DBAs plus a dedicated Manager.       I&#8217;ve learned a ton from my mentors and have even been able to turn      the tables once or twice and taught them!  It&#8217;s a hardworking group      and we all share the burden.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">5)  Stability. </span></div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 14.25pt;">I&#8217;ve worked for companies in the past where you aren&#8217;t sure if      they&#8217;re going to still be in business from month to month.  I&#8217;ve also      had a contract job where it was down to week to week.  I must be      getting older because stability is something that means more and more to      me.  While other companies were shrinking or go disappearing during      the Great Recession, my company actually grew and expanded.</span></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">This month&#8217;s #Meme15 topic is on Facebook and people balance mixing family, friends, peers and co-workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think the best way for me to answer the question of how I balance mixing family, friends, peers and co-workers, is to talk my history with Facebook.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/kconan/FB Start.JPG?mtime=1331683448"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kconan/FB Start.JPG?mtime=1331683448" alt="" width="427" height="131" /></a></div>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many years prior to joining Facebook, I moved from Canada to the Minneapolis, MN area.  In 2007 I joined MySpace because most of my of American friends were on it.  At the same time, I kept getting e-mails from friends back in Canada to join Facebook.  On April 18th of 2007, I finally caved to them and joined Facebook.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It really blew my mind just how much better of a product Facebook was at the time compared to MySpace.  I was not only able to find several of my friends from Canada, I was able to find many family members too.  To give you an idea of just how large my family is, my father is the oldest of 9 siblings and my mother was the youngest of 10 siblings!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest thing that Facebook gave me was the ability to easily stay in contact with people who now lived hundreds of miles away.  Like most people at the time, I was fascinated with finding people who I hadn&#8217;t talked to over 10 years.  People such as those I went to <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">elementary </span>school with or worked with at my first few jobs.  It was really cool to be able to catch up and reconnect with these people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just like many people, I can be competitive.  So when a good buddy of mine started telling how he has over 150 friends on Facebook, I knew I could top that.  I cannot remember for sure, but I believe I peaked at close to 450 friends in the fall of 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2010 and 2011, I spent 9 weeks across 3 trips to China for my work.  I was once again using Facebook regularly while in China to keep in contact with people.  The reason I did this was two-fold.  First, the area I was in is almost exactly the opposite time of day as here (CST).  So when I would get back to the hotel from work at 6 PM, it would be 5 AM CDT.  That make it very difficult to call people and made it very isolating.  The second reason was to share images and talk about what I was experiencing out there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/kconan/China Parking.jpg?mtime=1331684769"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kconan/China Parking.jpg?mtime=1331684769" alt="" width="419" height="546" /></a></div>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back in 2007, I really did not care who saw my status updates or any of the <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">embarrassing </span>photos of me.  Over the next 5 years, many things changed in my life.  I met and married the most amazing woman in the world, changed jobs, bought a house and met many great people who have all influenced my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As things kept changing, I started thinking more and more about who was seeing what about me online.  I was also tired of the newsfeed being full of stories of people who I was not close to.  So in the fall of 2011 I decided to go through my friend list and kept only people who were family, that I was close to or who are  interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today I am down to 184 friends and I will not let just anyone be a friends with me on Facebook.  This was probably the best thing I could to do to keep using Facebook.  Now when I look at the newsfeed, it&#8217;s full of things that I am really interested in seeing.  I&#8217;m also far less concerned about my privacy because these are all people that I trust.  (Facebook themselves privacy issues are another subject all together).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My advice is to keep Facebook personal so that you can enjoy it as much as possible.</p>
