				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bing is the latest version of a search engine developed by Microsoft. Microsoft was developing and testing for the last couple of months a search engine with the name Kumo which in Japanese means spider or cloud. Kumo was of course just the code name for what would become eventually Bing. </p>
<p>Search is very important because 1% of the search market is roughly worth 1 billion dollars. This means that the number two player can make some decent money. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have to become number one but they need to just grab around 30% or so and they are in good shape. Since Bing was launched it actually surpassed Yahoo and took market share away from both Google and Yahoo. Google must be eyeing this with great interest because a couple of weeks ago the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a> decision engine was launched and now Bing is here. Did you see the pathetic answer from Google to WolframAlpha named <a href="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=wolfram">Google Squared</a></p>
<p>I have tried to use a search engine developed by Microsoft several times in the past. I tried MSN search and it didn’t do the job, I tried LiveSearch and that was barely better. </p>
<p>With Bing Microsoft finally hit the nail on its head. The search works and finally you can use Bing as a verb: let me Bing that. That is much better than let me MSNSearch that for you. </p>
<p>I switched all my browsers for a week and I must say surprisingly that I did not use Google even once. Bing is as good as Google and has also some nice additional features. Type <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=New+York+to+miami+flights&amp;go=&amp;form=QBRE">New York to miami flights</a> into the search bar. Here is what you see. </p>
<p><img src="http://imgur.com/Y9K9g.png" alt="New York to miami flights" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Look at the green arrow and the process predicted to rise box. This is a nice feature; buy the ticket now because the price is predicted to go up soon</p>
<p>If you type <a href="http://www.bing.com/shopping/search?q=Nike+Shoes&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=BPFD">Nike Shoes</a> and click on shopping you will get something like this.</p>
<p><img src="http://imgur.com/uj1A7.png" alt="Nike Shoes search on Bing" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you then click on <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?q=Nike+Shoes&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=BYFD">maps</a> from the menu on top you will get a list of stores on a map.</p>
<p>If you do a search for something like <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=leave+Britney+alone&amp;go=&amp;form=QBRE">leave Britney alone</a> you will see a bunch of video on top</p>
<p><img src="http://imgur.com/brZq5.png" alt="leave Britney alone" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you just hover over the play button the video will start to play</p>
<p>If you are a developer then take a look at the <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/?FORM=ZZFD3">Project Silk Road</a></p>
<p><strong>Bing API 2.0</strong><br />
A key part of Project Silk Road is a re-architected Bing API that offers open, flexible options for building or enhancing your site or applications. Developing an application with the new API is straightforward: Choose a SourceType (or SourceTypes – you’re not limited to one), choose an output protocol (JSON, SOAP, or XML) and then customize according to your needs. All you need to get going is an AppID.<br />
Key improvements to the Bing API include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple protocols: JSON, XML, SOAP</li>
<li>Multiple SourceTypes: Web, Images, InstantAnswer, Phonebook, RelatedSearch, Spell, and more…</li>
<li>Unlimited use for customer-facing sites and applications</li>
<li>Flexible presentation options: No restrictions on ordering and blending results</li>
</ul>
<p>I doubt that a majority of people will make the switch because I don’t think it is so much better than Google to make people switch who have been using Google for a long time. For new computer users Bing is good enough that there is no reason to switch to Google</p>
<p><strong>How do you make Bing your default search engine?</strong><br />
In FireFox just go to this link and download the Bing search engine<br />
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:4/cat:all?sort=name</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer 8 you can get bing from here: http://www.ieaddons.com/en/searchproviders</p>
<p>In Chrome you click on the tools icon, select options, default search engine and then click manage (see picture below)</p>
<p><img src="http://imgur.com/a4dEo.png" alt="Make Bing default in Chrome" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I would love to hear your opinion, did you try Bing and what did you think of it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/sql-server-zipcode-latitude-longitude-pr">2005- Version</a> and <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/sql-server-2008-proximity-search-with-th">2008 Version</a> George and Denis have already shown a couple of great ways to calculate distance between two pairs of latitude/longitude coordinates in SQL Server.  In SQL 2005 + there is a third option (Well, it was the second option until 2008 introduced the new Geography data type).  SQL 2005 was the first version of SQL Server to offer CLR integration &#8211; giving developers the ability to write their own functions and stored procs as .NET assemblies.  In addition to opening a whole new world of possibilities to SQL developers, when used wisely these functions/procs will in some cases outperform standard T-SQL, especially when it comes to math and string manipulation.</p>
<p>So, lets get down to business.  First thing to do is create a class library to hold your functions.  You can do this in C# or VB.net, I won&#8217;t judge.  But I will use C#.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never tried to optimize this (it is pretty fast as is), but I am sure it is easily doable.  The important thing to notice here is the additional namespace directives (past System).  These allow you to use SQL Server types, Identify your function as a SQL Server function, and loads of other fun stuff.  I don&#8217;t actually use any of the SQL types in this function, but they do work well in most cases.  Its&#8217; easy to see the SqlFunction attribute applied to the method.</p>
<p>Once this is done, compile that sucker!  The trickiest part here is really deploying it to your server, but even that is simple, just a lot of steps.  First, you&#8217;ll need to put the file in a location where the server can see it. On the server would be a nice easy place.  Now we need to create an assembly in SQL Server for it.  This is simple too:</p>
<pre>CREATE ASSEMBLY DistanceCalculations FROM 'C:DistanceCalculationLibrary.dll'</pre>
<p>Ok, we&#8217;re getting close.  Once this assembly is created, you need to enable the CLR (it is disabled by default).</p>
<pre>exec sp_configure 'clr enabled',1
reconfigure</pre>
<p>And finally, create our SQL Server udf referencing the assembly.  </p>
<pre>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[clrDistCalc](@long1 [float], @lat1 [float], @long2 [float], @lat2 [float])
RETURNS [float] WITH EXECUTE AS CALLER
AS 
EXTERNAL NAME [DistanceCalculations].[UserDefinedFunctions].[clrDistCalc]</pre>
<p>You can test it by writing some queries against the same table used for Denis&#8217; example (or George&#8217;s).  Here&#8217;s an example using Denis&#8217; data:</p>

<p>If I know those guys like I think I do, the indexes and everything will be sufficient!  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s really all there is to it.  These CLR functions are an <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> powerful tool for any developer&#8217;s kit.  Math calculations are just scratching the surface of the great uses for this capability.  It is important to use them judiciously though, as with most powerful tools you can seriously injure yourself if not careful!  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve determined where the line is yet, but I would not even attempt using the CLR unless I was having performance issues with frequently used calculations (or they were frequently used enough that I could see the problem coming) or if I needed access to the filesystem or other resources that are awkward to access from straight T-SQL.  As developers we&#8217;re always going to need to make choices like this, and no amount of blog posts will make them for us.  So like all things, just use it wisely and you&#8217;ll be fine!  </p>
<p>In the future we&#8217;ll put all three to the test, and do a fourth post detailing the results.  At least I hope we will, the idea of doing just that is the whole reason I blogged about this again!</p>

<p>And how ironic is this? Google itself shows up as malware  LOL</p>
<p><a href="http://tinypic.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/2gvr5dv.jpg" border="0" alt="Google Is Malware?" /></a></p>
<p>Google seemed to have fixed this problem, Took about an hour or so&#8230;..wonder if they lost any money during this time</p>
<p>Here is what happened according to the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-site-may-harm-your-computer-on.html">Official Google Blog</a></p>
<blockquote><p>What happened? Very simply, human error. Google flags search results with the message &#8220;This site may harm your computer&#8221; if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. We do this to protect our users against visiting sites that could harm their computers. We maintain a list of such sites through both manual and automated methods. We work with a non-profit called StopBadware.org to come up with criteria for maintaining this list, and to provide simple processes for webmasters to remove their site from the list.</p>
<p>We periodically update that list and released one such update to the site this morning. Unfortunately (and here&#8217;s the human error), the URL of &#8216;/&#8217; was mistakenly checked in as a value to the file and &#8216;/&#8217; expands to all URLs. Fortunately, our on-call site reliability team found the problem quickly and reverted the file. Since we push these updates in a staggered and rolling fashion, the errors began appearing between 6:27 a.m. and 6:40 a.m. and began disappearing between 7:10 and 7:25 a.m., so the duration of the problem for any particular user was approximately 40 minutes.</p></blockquote>
