				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is a web developer? Recently I was involved in a discussion about the skills a web developer is expected to have and how interesting it has been to watch common bad practices (like table layout and SQL injection) continue to spread. So in the nature of Denis&#8217;s <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/MSSQLServer/what-does-a-sql-server" title="Read Denis's post">What does a SQL Server developer need to know?</a> post, I present the web developer breakdown.</p>
<h2>What Level Am I?</h2>
<p>Rather than try and attach years of experience to this scale, I&#8217;m going to present a list of major areas and skills, questions, or topics in each area. I&#8217;ve tried to capture whether I feel a skill is required to be an Intermediate or Advanced web developer. </p>
<p>I put this list together based on my own experience, 20-30 web developer interview lists, and some feedback from others.</p>
<p>Beginner: Knows some of the items on the list<br />
Intermediate: Knows most intermediate items and some advanced<br />
Advanced: Knows almost everything on the list</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Missing</h2>
<p>There are several things that were intentionally left out of this list. Some were hard to quantity in a general manner, others I was unsure how relevant they were. And I&#8217;m sure people will be kind enough to add additional oversights and revisions below.</p>
<p>Missing Categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level of knowledge with server-side languages</li>
<li>Project management skills</li>
<li>Documentation and Modeling skills</li>
<li>Design and Graphics skills</li>
<li>Application Lifecycle Management &#8211; Source Control, Deployment, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra items that didn&#8217;t make it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can implement RSS and ATOM feeds</li>
<li>Can implement a web farm</li>
<li>Implemented single-signon (openID, SAML, etc)</li>
<li>Knows how to implement XML data islands (still relevant?)</li>
<li>Knows how to create DTDs and/or XSDs</li>
<li>Can write regular expressions without a reference</li>
<li>Knows relevant tools for Yahoo (SiteExplorer), Google, Bing for managing site information</li>
<li>Schema.org &#8211; it belongs in the Meta category but I didn&#8217;t know what level of skill, knowledge, or adoption I should include considering it&#8217;s newness and several other factors</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the fact that we often get caught up maintaining or even adding on to a site that violates many of the skills and standards you see in this list. This doesn&#8217;t prevent us from writing good, clean, semantic sites the rest of the time and being forced to write poor code does not make on inherently less skilled.</p>
<h2>A Brief Digression, or Why an App Dev is Not a Web Dev</h2>
<p>At one point web development was seen as less exciting and far less complex than application development. It is still seen as extremely similar to application development, so much so that it is quite normal to hire a good or great application developer and expect them to be a good or great web developer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t quite work that way, as web development has grown extremely complex since the first dynamic sites started showing up in the late 90&#8217;s. Doubly unfortunately, web development is based on a stateless model instead of the stateful one most application developers are used to, uses a fluid layout instead of the grid layout, and sneaks a lot of extra communications and caching into the mix. This is a series of paradigm shifts not unlike the one between procedural, object oriented, and functional programming.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As technical people in a field that is expanding daily, we all run into areas that we know poorly, or haven&#8217;t been able to refresh our knowledge on this decade. For me, and I&#8217;m sure many of you, SEO is one of those topics that fell by the wayside. Sure, I remember circa-1998 tips on getting the search engines to rank your site more highly, such as making sure my meta tags are filled in, using terms frequently that you want to attach to your key search values, even trying to keep the content-to-crap ratio as high as possible. But no one is paying me high dollar to come improve their site rankings, so it is obvious I was missing a few steps. </p>
<h2>The New Site, v1</h2>
<p>Every few years I throw away my website and re-invent it. This time I had decided to create an extended professional profile with a secondary goal of bringing together my online handle (Tarwn) and my real name (Eli Weinstock-Herman). That link wasn&#8217;t completely missing, but it was tenuous and this was the first time I purposefully set out to link the technical postings and articles under my handle to my real name. Eighteen hours gave me a site that I felt was a step better than my previous one..and the crushing realization that I had no idea how to capture my personal brand and be the number one search result for my own name(s). Google was listing me (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tarwn" title="Google results for Tarwn">Both</a> of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eli+weinstock-herman" title="Google results for Eli Weinstock-Herman">me</a>) on the front page, but for older content that no longer existed and my profile on many other sites. Bing didn&#8217;t even have links to an old version of my site for one of my names. Ask and Yahoo? Similar stores, there were links and many of them were me, but my site was not in a prominent position. Luckily both my names are unique enough that I was really only competing with myself, albeit myself on much higher dollar, professional sites.</p>
<p>Time to hit the books.</p>
<h2>Instant Knowledge&#8230;</h2>
<p>I won&#8217;t lead you down all the blind alleys, scams, and occasionally clueless articles I ran into. Instead I&#8217;ll leave you with a few key links that stood out during my beginners education.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors" title="read the Article">Search Ranking Factors</a></dt>
<dd>A high level list of SEO factors, listed by importance with additional feedback from SEO experts on each answer.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.webconfs.com/15-minute-seo.php" title="Read the Article">15 Minute SEO</a></dt>
<dd>I don&#8217;t know how up to date this article is, but wow. Everything you need to know, nicely packaged in one humongous table. After reading through this table (and various articles when I googled common terms), I immediately started rethinking my content. </dd>
<dt><a href="http://tool.motoricerca.info/robots-checker.phtml" title="To the Checker!">Robots File Checker</a></dt>
<dd>A little web form tool to test a potential robots file and make sure it is formatted correctly.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://woorank.com/" title="Visit the WooRank site">WooRank</a></dt>
<dd>WooRank is a tool that calculates a ranking for your site based on common SEO factors, performance, and existing links. Every red light gave me one more topic to learn about.</dd>
<dt><a href-"http://www.seounique.com/blog/anchor-text-optimization/" title="Read the Article">Anchor Text Optimization</a></dt>
<dd>As I continued to fine tune, I ran into an article that focused entirely on link text optimization. Many sites pointed out the importance of backlinks, but this was the first that went in depth on selecting appropriate text and content for those links.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.traffictravis.com/" title="Visit the TrafficTravis site">Traffic Travis</a></dt>
<dd>Traffic Travis is a set of tools that allows you to analyze your website, keyword usage, search indices, and several more key indicators that hep you track whether changes you are making are improving or degrading your position. The tools have a free version, with more extensive abilities available with the premium version.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://google.com/analytics" title="Visit Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a></dt>
<dd>In order to try and get a handle on outstanding issues, I added my site to Google Analytics and watched it daily. I tweaked my (until then missing) robots file to keep the search engines pointed at the pages I wanted them on, instead of the ones they had somehow found, and watched the traffic each day to see what was getting picked up.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: 1em; font-style: italic">Note: if you visit my site&#8217;s <a href="http://tiernok.com/" title="Tarwn's About Site page">About page</a>, you will notice a simple graphic on the right side that shows time for ongoing development. Each of these bars (after the first few) were driven from the Analytics and Ranking tools, as I continue to expand the site, attempt to engage my target keywords, and capture existing search engine topics that previously linked to me.</div>
<p></p>
<h2>The Results, so Far</h2>
<p>After less than 10 hours invested in both learning from the links and tools above, and applying that knowledge to my site, I achieved the top position in Google for both &#8220;Tarwn&#8221; and &#8220;Eli Weinstock-Herman&#8221;. I do have to admit I feel a little bad, though, as I have apparently also started edging into the results of someone named <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eli+page" title="Try the google search">&#8220;Eli Page&#8221;</a> by complete accident. Bing has me listed for 3 and 4 currently, which is great considering I started on page two with one of my names. Yahoo has gracefully given me top spots for both names, once again just barely nudging my LinkedIn profile down to second place. </p>
<p>Unfortunately there were no quick secrets to what I did (and continue to do). I read and re-read the articles I found from searching terms on the 15-minute article, use the tools above every few days to continue to tweak and change values, and read up on every suggestion I see mentioned in the WooRank results. Considering my low traffic rate (by design) and the purpose of my site (help people learn more about me), I would consider my result to be a success. I did not intend to become an expert in the magic of SEO, just a basic practitioner. I not only achieved the result I wanted, I also am continuing to practice those skills and have learned enough to speak intelligently (and filter out basic scams) the next time someone wants to sell me SEO services. I may not be an expert, but at least now I could listen to one and understand the language.</p>
