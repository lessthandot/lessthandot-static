<p><em>1) The current support matrix for OSes is as follows:<br />
 Windows Vista SP2 or later<br />
 Windows Server 2008 SP2 or later<br />
 Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later<br />
 Windows 7 SP1 or later</p>
<p>2) Denali will support upgrading from these SQL Server versions:<br />
 SQL Server 2005 SP4 or later<br />
 SQL Server 2008 SP2 or later<br />
 SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later</em></p>
<p>As you can see there is no Windows XP on that list. I am fine with that for a couple of reasons</p>
<p>1) Denali is not out yet, it might be another year before it goes RTM, and even if it is released a good number of companies wait for service pack 1. By the time that happens a lot of those XP machines might be running Windows 7</p>
<p>2) Nothing prevents you from running a Windows 7 virtual instance on your XP box so that you can still do your work</p>
<p>3) There is always Query Analyzer, Query Analyzer should connect to Denali without a problem, it connects to 2008 R2 just fine</p>
<p>So what do you think, will this be a roadblock for you?</p>

<p>If you are a not a TechNet or MSDN subscriber, you have to wait until February 22nd  to download yours. </p>
<p>If you have been patching your Windows 7 machine then you already have most of what is in the service pack, the service pack is just a rollup of all the patches that have been issued since Windows 7 was released. It is still handy if you have a new machine since you don&#8217;t need to then download all the patches</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that Windows 7 has a GodMode? What GodMode does is enable you to have a place where you can get to all the settings without having to browse around and click through options and folders in control panel.</p>
<p>Add a new folder to your desktop and name it <strong>GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}</strong><br />
After that is done you will see the following icon on your desktop</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/GodmodeIcon.png" alt="" title="" width="78" height="80" /></div>
<p>Now when you click on that icon you it will open up the following folder&#8230;isn&#8217;t that cool?</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/mongo/GodMode2.png?mtime=1357606733"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/mongo/GodMode2.png?mtime=1357606733" width="733" height="859" /></a></div>
<p>By the way there is much more in this folder than in the screenshot, in the screenshot you only see 4 sections, in the folder there are 46 different ones</p>
<p><strong> <span class="MT_red">Warning&#8230;although GodMode works on Vista 32 bit and 32 bit Windows Server 2008 it does not work on Vista 64 bit sp2 and 64 bit Windows Server 2008&#8230;see comments to fix it if you tried it on those operating systems</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4036474540/" title="Win 7 Logo by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2699/4036474540_2094c780f9_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Win 7 Logo" /></a><br />
This post is not a review, you can find detailed reviews all over the internet, this is just about the Windows 7 launch in New York City which I attended today. If you click on the pictures you can get larger sizes.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 on all my home machines since it became available from MSDN in August. I think that this is the best operating system that Microsoft created yet, you can tell that 8 million people have beta tested this puppy. When I upgraded my old <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/3090565420/">IBM T43 laptop</a> to Windows 7 I noticed immediately that it was faster than XP and also used less RAM, on my new desktop Windows 7 uses 600 MB less RAM (I have 6 Gigs) than Vista. My favorite new features in Windows 7 are Jump lists and Aero peek, I think people will really appreciate jump lists. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4036464788/" title="Monitors by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2795/4036464788_3db9bcea03.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Monitors" /></a></p>
<p>The launch even was held in Soho in a loft which was probably used as an art gallery at other times. It was interesting that this event was only for press, partners and invited guests&#8230;..this time there would be no..developers&#8230; developers&#8230; developers coming out of Steve Ballmer&#8217;s mouth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Remember Kylie from that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssOq02DTTMU">&#8216;cute&#8217; windows 7 commercial</a>? She was there, she introduced Steve Ballmer and he gave her a pink laptop&#8230;.very cute<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4036467632/" title="Ballmer Gives Laptop by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2540/4036467632_1fd5fa76c4_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Ballmer Gives Laptop" /></a></p>
<p>Ballmer explained some of the things that happened during the creation of Windows 7.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035720493/" title="Ballmer by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2747/4035720493_9c96b970a6_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Ballmer" /></a> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4036472382/" title="Ballmer Presentation by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2460/4036472382_b78faa8f75_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Ballmer Presentation" /></a> </p>
<p>After Ballmer was done with his presentation 7 cool things that Windows 7 can do was presented. The thing that impressed me the most is when they had video, tv and pictures on 8 different monitors from a single DELL XPS machine&#8230;.that was pretty cool. Netflix on a touchscreen looked pretty nice&#8230;.also shown was a kindle app for Windows 7.</p>
<p>After all this they opened a partition where all the partners had their hardware setup. Some of these devices you can see in the pictures below<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035729307/" title="Hardware by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/4035729307_02c3575b70.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Hardware" /></a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035730917/" title="Ballmer Inspecting by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3510/4035730917_119c175cd6.jpg" width="466" height="500" alt="Ballmer Inspecting" /></a></p>
<p>The 3D Batman game was cool looking&#8230;initially I thought that the screen was fuzzy but then I noticed that I needed to wear the special glasses on the table; after I put the glasses on the game looked really crisp and had that 3D look and feel.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4036486848/" title="Batman 3D by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/4036486848_66225f72df.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Batman 3D" /></a></p>
<p>I spotted this Canon 7D with a 14mm 1.4 USM lens and played a little bit with it, interesting camera.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035735169/" title="Canon EOS D7 by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/4035735169_eefd708450.jpg" width="500" height="466" alt="Canon EOS D7" /></a></p>
<p>This Alienware laptop was pretty nice,keys lit up, quad core but nobody would give me a price for it:-(<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035737381/" title="Alienware by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2783/4035737381_1191d9197a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Alienware" /></a></p>
<p>There were 3 bars, one of them had a bunch of coffee machines and the other 2 had Champagne and Sodas<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035712229/" title="Bar by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2576/4035712229_3b1c29def8_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Bar" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe you know that twitter did a deal with Bing where Bing would get access to twitter&#8217;s firehouse so that it could do real time search, the pic below shows a real time search for Windows 7 which is refereshed every time someone tweets about Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4035739081/" title="Twitter Bing Live Update by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2502/4035739081_dc847c530d.jpg" width="449" height="500" alt="Twitter Bing Live Update" /></a></p>
<p>At the end you got a bag, inside was a puzzle, a poster, a book, a t-shirt, playing cards and Windows 7 Ultimate Signature Edition<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/4036491118/" title="Win 7 Signature Edition by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2651/4036491118_a1089b2475.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Win 7 Signature Edition" /></a></p>
<p>Now Microsoft has to wait and see how well Windows 7 will do, most if not all reviews have been positive so it should be a sure thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are upgrading from windows xp to windows 7 there is a change in the way you install Internet Information Services. On windows xp you would install IIS from add/remove windows components. This is different in Windows 7; it is very similar how it is done on Vista.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel and click on Programs, on the following screen click on Turn Windows features on or off (see image below)</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS1.PNG?mtime=1357140507"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS1.PNG?mtime=1357140507" width="663" height="120" /></a></div>
<p>
After that, select Internet Information Services and click ok</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS2.PNG?mtime=1357140588"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/IIS2.PNG?mtime=1357140588" width="403" height="190" /></a></div>
<p>
You will be presented with a progress box and when that is done you will probably need to restart you machine.</p>
<p>After you restarted, type http://localhost/ in the address bar of a browser and if IIS was started successfully you should see the message: Internet Information Services is running</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every time you buy a new computer you of course need to install a bunch of software. In my case this would be stuff mostly from MSDN </p>
<p><em>Visual Studio 2008 + Service pack 1<br />
SQL Server 2008 + Service pack 1<br />
Expression Studio 2<br />
Win XP SP 3 (to run on a virtual machine)<br />
Windows 7 RC (to run on a virtual machine)<br />
Visual Studio 2010 (to run inside the Win 7 virtual machine)<br />
Office 2007 Ultimate</em></p>
<p>The nice thing about Virtual machines is that you can mount an ISO right inside the machine, this way you don&#8217;t have to burn a CD or install a ISO mounter inside the virtual machine itself</p>
<p>If you upgraded from Windows XP to Vista you probably wonder how to mount images. On XP you might have used alcohol or the VCdControlTool provided (but unsupported) by Microsoft. On Vista (and I am running the 64 bit version) you can use <a href="http://www.magiciso.com/">MagicISO</a>. If you end up using this tool on a regular basis the I would suggest paying the $29 for it otherwise companies will stop making tools like this.<br />
MagicISO is very easy to use. After you install the program you will see a new icon in the  taskbar.</p>
<p>To mount an ISO do the following<br />
In the taskbar right click on the MagicISO button<br />
<img src="http://imgur.com/xVFHL.jpg" alt="In the taskbar right click on the MagicISO button" /></p>
<p>Select the topmost entry labeled Virtual CD/DVD-ROM, click on K: No Media<br />
<img src="http://imgur.com/tnvGo.jpg" alt="Select the topmost entry labeled Virtual CD/DVD-ROM, click on K: No Media" /></p>
<p>After that select Mount<br />
<img src="http://imgur.com/i47jQ.jpg" alt="After that select Mount" /></p>
<p>Now navigate to the folder that you have the ISO in<br />

<p>Now you can either run the program immediately or click on the K drive. It is as simple as that. MagicISO has versions optimized for Win 7 and Server 2008 and versions optimized for Vista</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visual Studio 2010 has been made available to MSDN subscribers yesterday. I downloaded Visual Studio 2010 today and installed it on Windows 7 RC. I took some images so that you can see what it looks like</p>
<p>The new welcome screen in Visual Studio 2010</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20101.png?mtime=1357606093"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20101.png?mtime=1357606093" width="735" height="521" /></a></div>
<p>
In Visual Studio 2010 you can target frameworks 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20102.png?mtime=1357606111"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20102.png?mtime=1357606111" width="605" height="657" /></a></div>
<p>
The toolbox has changed in Visual Studio 2010. it looks a lot cleaner to me. Finally we have a toolbox which does not resemble the Visual Basic 4 toolbox anymore</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20103.png?mtime=1357606121"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20103.png?mtime=1357606121" width="864" height="643" /></a></div>
<p>
Finally here is what a WPF project looks like</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20104.png?mtime=1357606132"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20104.png?mtime=1357606132" width="436" height="638" /></a></div>
<p></p>
<p>So what do you think, do you like the looks of Visual Studio 2010?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have all seen sites that popup messages telling you that your IE6 browser is insecure and that you should upgrade to IE7/8, FireFox or Chrome. The reason for this is of course that IE6 is a terrible browser to develop against; nobody wants to spend half their time putting in CSS hacks so that their webpage looks halfway decent. Some sites like <a href="http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/07/basecamp-phasin.html">37signals decided to dump IE6</a> completely </p>
<p>So here is the problem with this, most companies I interact with won’t let you run as an administrator and you cannot install a single thing. Yeah you can download another browser but you can’t install it. Most of these companies also have windows update disabled on the machines, updates are pushed through LANDesk. A new browser is not part of these update pushes. Just imagine that you call help desk to ask them to install a new browser on your machine. Most probably you will get an answer that IE6 is the corporate standard and that it is the browser you have to use.</p>
<p>Of course some companies developed internal apps that use ActiveX and will only work on IE6, this is another reason that IE6 will not go away any time soon.</p>
<p>On our site IE6 still commands about 30% usage of total IE usage. Here is the breakdown for the last 10 months</p>
<pre>Aug 2008 30.06%
Sep 2008 31.14%
Oct 2008 30.10%
Nov 2008 28.62%
Dec 2008 28.95%
Jan 2009 29.74%
Feb 2009 30.38%
Mar 2009 29.73%
Apr 2009 25.90%
May 2009 24.76%</pre>
<p>As you can see it was around 30% until April and then it dropped. This drop is probably because of the introduction of IE8 in April at Mix09</p>
<p>Here is all IE for May</p>
<pre>IE7 57.73%	
IE6 24.76%	
IE8 17.51%</pre>
<p>As you can see IE8 is closing in on IE6 fast, it is however also taking market share away from IE7</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how many people will upgrade to Windows 7 this year, so far XP is still king For the month of May 2009 XP traffic was 68.24% of all windows machines on our site</p>
