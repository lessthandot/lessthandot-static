				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SQL Server Days 2014 is over, but it has been one great event. A very big thanks to the organizers! My session went pretty well, somewhere around 60 attendees I would guess and they didn&#8217;t seem too bored. I saw some other great sessions as well, such as Buck Woody (<a href="https://twitter.com/buckwoody">twitter</a>) on Big Data (and a fantastic keynote) and a demo session on Azure ML. I also attended Grants (<a href="https://twitter.com/GFritchey">twitter </a>| <a href="http://www.scarydba.com/">blog</a>) precon on execution plans and I definitely learned a lot.</p>
<p>It was great to meet up with the #sqlfamily and I can&#8217;t wait for next years edition.</p>
<p>I have uploaded my slides to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KoenVerbeeck/sql-server-days-2014-how-to-not-torment-your">Slideshare</a>, in case you&#8217;re interested.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">I am absolutely delighted to share the great news that I have been selected as one of the speakers for the 2014 edition of the <a href="http://sqlserverdays.be/">SQL Server Days</a> in Belgium. It is one of the biggest SQL Server events in Europe and this will be the 4th time I am presenting there. A lot of great names of the #sqlfamily have also been confirmed, such as Grant Fritchey, Denny Cherry, Stacia Misner, KlausÂ Asschenbrenner, Marco Russo, AndrÃ© Kamman and many many other talented speakers. There are also some great precons, most notably in the BI space the Power BI precon by Jen Stirrup and the SSAS Tabular precon by Julie Koesmarno.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Anyway, my session is titled <em>&#8220;How to (not) torment your fellow SSIS developer?&#8221;</em> and its abstract is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Did you ever inherited a slow running un-maintainable mess of an SSIS package? Or do you want to knock up your SSIS developing skills to the next level?Â </em><em>This session will guide you through common SSIS best practices and performance pitfalls. We will make packages easier to read, maintain and more efficient.</em></p>
<p><em>You will learn some practical tips to make your life â€“ and that of your successor â€“ easier.</em></p>
<p>It is a level 300 session, meaning that I will not explain how SSIS works and I will dive straight into some best practices and performance tuning, assuming the audience can tell a control flow and a data flow apart from each other. Basically this session will explain how an SSIS package should look like and behave, at least in my opinion. In other words, if I inherit a package from someone else what stops me from pulling out my hair <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So if you want to learn more about SSIS or if you want to watch other great sessions (5 different tracks with each 5 slots!), do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/registration/">register</a>! There is an early bird discount until the July 15th.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Two weeks ago I had the pleasure of giving a session on the Belgian <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/2012/" target="_blank">SQL Server Days</a>. My session was about SSIS and the new features of Change Data Capture (CDC). With new features I mean the new SSIS 2012 components made by Attunity who simplify the manageability and usability of SSIS packages working with CDC, because technically CDC hasnâ€™t changed since its introduction in SQL Server 2008.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">The session went quite well (still waiting on attendee feedback), aside from some microphone problems who forced me to hold a replacement microphone in my left hand â€“ quite difficult to do demos and use Zoomit â€“ and a transaction that got stuck in SSMS and was stubborn enough not to roll back quickly. But these little setbacks didnâ€™t get in the way of the message of the session and they only made myself stronger as a speaker.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">The Belgian SQL Server User Group, <a href="http://sqlug.be/" target="_blank">SQLUG.be</a>, will make all slides available for the attendees, but for those who couldnâ€™t attend the event I decided to put them online anyway. The slides can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KoenVerbeeck/sqlserverdays2012ssiscdc" target="_blank">SlideShare</a> and the demo material can be found <a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/SQLServerDays2012_SlidesDemos/SSIS-CDC Demo.zip?mtime=1354310401">here</a>. Basically the demos consist of the following:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">Set-up scripts creating some databases and transferring data from AdventureWorksDW2012.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">A T-SQL script showing CDC functionality as it was introduced in SQL Server 2008.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">A SSIS package for the initial load.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">A SSIS package for the incremental load.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">A SSIS package for the incremental load but with the addition of the __$reprocessing indicator.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">If you have questions about this material, feel free to ask them in the comments.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">For more information on SSIS and CDC, check out the resources I listed at the end of the presentation.</span></p>
