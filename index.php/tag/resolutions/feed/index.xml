				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been two months since I posted my resolution for 2013, you can find that post here: <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/ProfessionalDevelopment/ah-yes-those-pesky-resolutions">Ah yes, those pesky resolutions</a>. Today I decided to take a look at how I am doing two months into the year.</p>
<p><strong>Read more technical books</strong><br />
I only read one technical book so far, this book is<br />
 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290068/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1617290068">The Well-Grounded Java Developer: Vital techniques of Java 7 and polyglot programming</a>. I have reviewed the book here: <a href="/index.php/EnterpriseDev/AppServer/JEE/review-of-the-well-grounded">Review of The Well-Grounded Java Developer</a>. In a couple of weeks I will have the opportunity (some people will call it a misfortune, misfortune being the commute not the reading part) to read a lot more since I will be commuting 2 hours a day on the lovely NJ Transit Northeast Corridor train.<br />
Depending what happens in the next couple of weeks the technology stack is not yet certain for me, this is why I have not purchased any books yet, I hope to have this sorted out by April 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Get into different technologies</strong><br />
As you might have noticed I did a bunch of posts about technologies besides SQL Server, I did a couple of Oracle posts as well as a couple of Scala posts. I also did a bunch of posts about MongoDB, as a matter of fact I blogged 15 times about MongoDB, you can find the MongoDB posts below</p>

<p><strong>Write more blog posts and contribute more to the wiki</strong><br />
I think that I did really well here, I wrote 47 posts so far this year, this is more than half of all the posts that I wrote in 2012. I said my goal was to blog 150 times this year, I am almost 30% done with that goal. I actually decided to bring my total posts to 750, this means I still have to write 198 posts this year to hit that goal. We will see if I make it or not. Here is where you can find all the posts I have written broken down by year: /index.php/All/?disp=authdiryearly&amp;author=4</p>
<p>I am not checking up on the other goals because I have not done anything about them yet</p>
