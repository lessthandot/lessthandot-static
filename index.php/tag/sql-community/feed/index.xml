<p>The SQL Community is an important part to everything I do both in work and pleasure.  Over the last year, I&#8217;ve started to realize that the work aspect to my life could be pushed higher and at the same time, pushed more into a role that benefits the SQL Community.  It is always hard to disconnect yourself as a production DBA from the systems that you build and nurture from a failing service into an enterprise worthy service.  Even so, I&#8217;ve made the decision to part with those systems and my current employer to move into a role that will for one, be more challenging and second, a company that supports both the community and has great pride in the product and services they provide.</p>
<p>After this week comes to an end, I will be moving to the <a href="http://www.magenic.com/">Magenic</a> family.  I say family because over the months of talking to them I quickly realized that the group at Magenic truly is a family.  Not only one that holds themselves together with a high level of expertise but one that openly draws off each others knowledge and skills. </p>
<p>All job changes come with a certain amount of disconnect while the adjustments are made.  I hope this change will be quick so I can keep to my goals of helping the community from the forum, blog and speaking side of things.  I would like to thank everyone (and I mean everyone) in the community for the years of helping me push myself daily to be better.  I owe this change to all of you as much as anyone.</p>
<p>I look forward to the future and sharing everything it has with the community.</p>
<p>Personal thanks go out to my future new coworkers Aaron Lowe and Wendy Patrick.  I can’t wait to get the SQL Saturday in Chicago crew back together now in roles where we can take over the data architecture world!</p>

<p>Last year I attended SQL Saturday in Iowa and enjoyed it immensely.  I was glad to see a follow up for this year coming this Friday, September 18th.  This year I’m very happy to announce that I will be attending <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/eventhome.aspx">Iowa’s second SQL Saturday</a> and also contributing as a speaker.  If you have never been to a SQL Saturday event, I highly recommend attending this one or another in your area.  These events are free and organized by people just like you and I.  That means they know what you want to hear and how to present that information to you.  (Not to mention the awesome prizes that sponsors give out in the raffle)</p>
<p>These events are 100% free.  One of the other great aspects to the SQL Community, we have a vast amount of truly community orientated vendors that sponsor SQL Saturday events.  When you are attending, take the time out during lunch or between sessions to stop at the vendor booths to thank them and also find out what great new products they have to offer.</p>
<p>I will be talking about SQL Server Integration Services and coming from the ground up to running packages.</p>
<p><strong>The abstract for this session:</strong></p>
<p><i>This session discusses what is needed to install, develop, and execute a basic SSIS 2008 package. An overview of some basic yet powerful tasks available to administrators and developers as well as ways to increase the performance of commonly used tasks and components will be discussed briefly.</i> </p>
<p><span class="MT_under">We will cover</span> </p>
<ul>
<li>Planning and Installation Requirements</li>
<li>Developing a basic SSIS package </li>
<li>Importing/Exporting packages </li>
<li>SSIS issues to watch out for </li>
<li>Deploying an SSIS package to production </li>
<li>Differentiating various package storage methods </li>
<li>Running packages manually or on a schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also be giving away a free licensed for <a href="http://www.gerasus.com/">Gerasus&#8217;s SSIS-DTS Package Search 2.0</a>.  Very cool and useful product! </p>
<p>I look forward to this event and getting into some great conversations with the attendees as well as having the opportunity to sit in on the other great sessions that are scheduled.</p></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/robert_davis/archive/2010/07/04/T_2D00_SQL-Tuesday-008-Gettin-Schooled.aspx"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday1.gif" alt="" title="T-SQL Tuesday" width="154" height="154" align="left" /></a> Robert Davis (<a href="http://twitter.com/sqlsoldier">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/members/profile.aspx?UserID=2133">Blog</a>) has the control this month and who better to have it other than him.  I&#8217;ve come to respect Robert greatly over the last few months (yes, had no idea who he was just a short time ago).  That&#8217;s the point of community though, isn&#8217;t it?  We meet these leaders and professionals daily and scale up and out endlessly.  It truly has no limits and I&#8217;m honored to be part of it. </p>
<p>As the host of T-SQL Tuesday this month, Robert has the topic of Getting&#8217; schooled.  I&#8217;m going to take the topic and wander around a bit, not specifically about how I learn or teach, but how you can represent yourself by learning and teaching.  </p>
<p>This month&#8217;s topic in my opinion is one of the single most important topics we as the community have to offer others that are coming up in our field.  This month we ask ourselves and the entire community three simple but extremely complex questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you learn?</li>
<li>How do you teach? </li>
<li>What are you learning or teaching?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The mission</strong></p>
<p>Each one of these questions has the same level of importance.  Without one, the others fall short and become an unsolvable equation.  In order for us as individuals and a community to grow, we must embrace learning but cannot fall short of passing our knowledge on in our <strong>daily</strong> teachings.  I emphasize the word <i>daily</i> in that last statement, because this is a 24/7 job we should all take seriously.   Sometimes we pass on our knowledge by teaching in a simple sentence or in some cases even a subtle nudge of a word like profiler or Pivot.  Each and every time we make the effort to pass these things on, we not only help the ones in need, but continue to build something that so many of us have come to cherish: Our SQL Community.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/learnlead_2.gif" alt="" title="" width="200" height="267" align="left" /></div>
<p><strong>Learning not to make messes</strong></p>
<p>Everyone in a professional career that involves the constant evolution of computing will be successful while retaining the daily mindset that we always keep learning.  This learning process does isn&#8217;t limited to what we already know or what we&#8217;ve done.  What we know and have done is the foundation of where we can lift ourselves further by learning more in-depth on our knowledge and gain new knowledge of what we may have not found ourselves needing day-today yet.  This assists us to better ourselves and improve upon our skills.  Our learning foundation is only as good as the manner in which we look upon our accomplishments with great humility.  Doing so allows us to look into our skills and learn to better them while gaining the new skills that we can continue to grow on.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/learnlead.gif" alt="" title="" width="225" height="137" align="right" /></div>
<p>
<strong>Teach to learn</strong>
<p>Teaching others has its benefits beyond the gratification of knowing you&#8217;ve passed what you know to others.  When we teach, we learn during the process.  There is great refinement and tuning in our skills and have the ability to interact with scenarios and variables that we may not otherwise ever come into contact with.  Teaching is more about learning than you may think.  With each blog, forum reply or session we give to a group of professionals, we absorb the feedback and interactions from them as much as they do from us.  </p>
<p>It may be a misconception that we cannot all be teachers in some way.  All of us have something to offer and putting energy into teaching it to others allows us to build our knowledge.  With that path, our personal and professional career potential has no limits.</p>
<p><strong>How then?</strong></p>
<p>How do you learn and how do you teach?  There is no doubt that it takes a great deal of energy to become a teacher in technology.  With the hard work and energy placed in our community, the goal of becoming a teacher can be obtained.  Events are all around us and they need speakers to pass on their knowledge.  User groups are always in need and I can guarantee you that the leaders and organizers of these events and user groups are open to new and established speakers alike.  We all start from somewhere and build upon it as we grow together in both teaching and learning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I woke up to a little over a hundred emails from one of my database servers letting me know that my resources were jumping around like a kangaroo.  Actually, more like a boxing match with one&#8230;</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/autoclose_2.gif" alt="" title="" width="380" height="263" /></div>
<p>In the mix of those emails I also had alerts thrown stating, </p>
<blockquote><p><i>[database_name_withheld] has a status of Suspect, Cleanly Shutdown</i></p></blockquote>
<p>
I actively monitor the state of the database being open or closed (which also shows status of suspect, recovering etc&#8230;)   I recommend the same so you catch these situations.  When I read the emails, I knew exactly what the setting was that had been set to true.  &#8220;Auto Close&#8221;</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/autclose.gif" alt="" title="" width="494" height="184" /></div>
<p>Why is this bad?  Buck Woody (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/buckwoody/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/buckwoody">Twitter</a>) tells us in his blog, &#8220;<i><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/buckwoody/archive/2009/06/24/sql-server-best-practices-autoclose-should-be-off.aspx">SQL Server Best Practices: AutoClose Should be Off</a></i>&#8220;</p>
<p>Basically, in the case of these alerts from my database server, what Buck explained is exactly what happened.  This database that was created by some vendor software had the setting of Auto Close on.   The software has a service running in the background and would poll for some data every five minutes or so and then close the connection it opened.  Yes, that is a good thing that it closes the connections.  But, what was happening was the resources on the server were going crazy due to consumption and releasing them every five minutes.  Literally over and over again it would do this.  This actually caused problems with the other databases and did exactly the opposite as you would think releasing resources would do.</p>
<p>Luckily Auto Close is on the, &#8220;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms135094(SQL.90).aspx">Kill</a>&#8221; list and will be gone soon (but not soon enough).  In my experience I haven’t found a use for it unless a database is opened once a month.  Personally, I don’t have any databases like that but maybe they are really out there.</p>
<p>Final thought – If you have a database that was recently created and you find Auto Close set to True, change it to False.  It is a best practice, won’t hurt anything and will prevent things like this situation from coming up.  Now lets see if I can restart this Saturday morning.</p>

<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday1.gif" alt="" title="T-SQL Tuesday" width="154" height="154" align="left" /></div>
<p></a>I’m jumping into the T-SQL Tuesday fun this week.  The very well known, Jorge Segarra (<a href="http://sqlchicken.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlchicken">twitter</a>) is <a href="http://sqlchicken.com/2010/06/t-sql-tuesday-007-summertime-in-the-sql/">hosting the fun</a> this time around.  It is a busy week at that with SQL University writing and everything going on in the SQL Community.  The SQL Server 2008 (R2) hottest, most favorite new feature topic had me wanting to throw SSIS out there once more and show off the Data Flow Engine changes.  OK, the Data Flow Engine isn&#8217;t a, &#8220;New Feature&#8221; but given the redesign, I&#8217;m throwing it into the mix with the rest.
</p>
<p>
This was a big, big and did I say BIG change in SSIS 2008.  Being a performance freak, the changes to the Data Flow and the effective use of multi-core processors was what had me the most excited.  See, with SSIS 2005, Data Flow was sent off on its merry way running execution trees with only one lonely execution thread.  That meant one thread!  This doesn’t help us much in a core happy world we live in.  So in SSIS 2008 we had a big change to this architecture.  Did I mention this was big?  </p>
<h3><strong>Off to the races we go with Pipeline Parallelism</strong></h3>
<p>What SSIS 2008 has given us over SSIS 2005 and the execution tree is the ability to run more than one component from the single tree.  This is really a huge change.  Before this change and automated thread scheduling in SSIS, we had to try making our own with designing methods.  In some cases the changes in designs caused other performance problems themselves.  Now with a thread pool, threads are assigned dynamically (yes, auto-magically) to components.  Thread pooling is not a new concept to the computing world (and .NET framework).   Thread pooling manages where and what work a set of threads will work on.   When work is thrown at the pool, the work is sent off to threads that can work on it.  This means multiple threads working on multiple jobs in parallel execution.  Thread pooling can be done manually but with SSIS and SQL Server, we like the concept of this being controlled without us causing problems.  In SSIS 2008 we were given just that automatic scheduling.</p>
<p>The question of the hour is, does this help us with performance?  The performance shines from the massive tests that have been done already and can answer the question for us.  If you haven’t heard of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlperf/archive/2008/02/27/etl-world-record.aspx">ETL World Record</a>, you need to get over there and check it out.  1 TB in 30 minutes!!  Yes, on SSIS 2008 and the architecture behind it.  </p>
<p>
The best way to check this out is to show the differences.  Robert Sheldon also went over this test on the, <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/ssis/sql-server-2008-ssis-cribsheet/">SSIS 2008 Crib sheet</a>.  Very cool write-up and recommended reading it.</p>
<h3><strong>The truth is in the pipe by logging it</strong></h3>
<p>
Let’s create a package that will run some data through so we can log the execution.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="MT_red">Note: the SSIS 2008 Crib sheet shows pretty much the same here.  Robert did an awesome job explaining all of this.  Highly recommend reading it.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Steps to the test SSIS in 2005 and 2008 so we can see the execution changes and speed differences
</p>
<ol>
<li>In BIDS 2005, create a new package named Pipes 2005</li>
<li>Bring over an OLE DB Source and connect this source to AdventureWorks.  </li>
<li>Bring in the table, Sales.SalesOrderDetail</li>
<li>Drop a Conditional Split into the Data Flow tab</li>
<li>Make the condition based on OrderQty being greater than one.  </li>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday2.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="76" /></div>
<li>Next, drag and drop two Derived Column’s</li>
<li>Make one Derived column the Case 1 output by connecting the first Path to it and selecting Case 1 output</li>
<li>Make the Expression (DT_STR,3,1252)ProductID + &#8221; for &#8221; + (DT_STR,3,1252)OrderQty</li>
<li>Change the Data Type to DT_STR (non-unicode string)</li>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday3.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="112" /></div>
<li>Do this for the next Derived Column by connecting the remaining output path to it.  </li>
<li>Name the column Under2orders and leave the Expression the same</li>
<li>Connect both Derived Columns to two unique SQL Server Destinations</li>
<li>In the SQL Server Destinations, use the same connection of AdventureWorks.  Click, New to create a new table.  Use the following CREATE TABLE statement:
<pre>CREATE TABLE [Playing_1] (
OrderOver1Unit varchar(10)
)</pre>
</li>
<li>Use this for the second destination but name the table, [Playing_2]</li>
<p>Our finished product should appear like below</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday4.gif" alt="" title="" width="444" height="381" /></div>
<li>Next, click the menu option SSIS and select Logging</li>
<li>Select package in the Containers and add a new SSIS log provider for Text files.</li>
<li>Add a path to the new log of C:ExecutionTreeSSIS_Test2005</li>
<li>Highlight Data Flow Task to move into logging the task.</li>
<li>Click Details in the right tabs and click the Advanced button </li>
<li>Scroll down a bit and check PipelineExecutionTree. </li>
<li>Uncheck everything except MessageText</li>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday5.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="317" /></div>
<li>Click OK until out of the editors and save the package. </li>
<li>Run the package from BIDS </li>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday6.gif" alt="" title="" width="474" height="409" /></div>
<p>And we have our data split and loaded</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/sqltuesday7.gif" alt="" title="" width="380" height="419" /></div>
<p>Execution time was 936 Milliseconds</p>
<p>SSIS 2005 PipelineExecutionTrees log</p>

We can see all of the work was primarily done in execution tree 0.   936 Milliseconds isn’t the greatest for what we just did either.</p>
<p>Now upgrade the package to 2008 by creating a new SSIS project.  Right click SSIS Packages in the Solution Explorer and select Add Existing.  Browse to the package we just created in SSIS 2005 (found in your projects folder in My Documents by default).  Double click the package to bring it in.<br />
You will receive the succeeded upgrade to SSIS 2008 message.  Click OK to close it and load the upgraded 2008 package.</p>
<p>Click the SSIS option in the menu strip and select lopping.  Change the path to the text file to be C:ExecutionTreeSSIS_Test2008<br />
Save and run the package</p>
<p>Package execution time for this was 640 Milliseconds.  Now check the log<br />

<p>Changes we can see in the logging are the Paths and the Subpaths.  This is showing the tasks being executed in the main path in parallel by using Subpaths.  </p>
<p>And our execution time was increased.  </p>
<h3><strong>Where’s the beef? Right there, in the Data Flow Engine</strong></h3>
<p>
The Data Flow Engine changes are truly an enhancement that pushes SSIS to the Enterprise ETL levels.  Don’t sell yourself short by dismissing the abilities of SSIS as anything less than performing at that level.

This post will illustrate two methods for removing old files from directories using SSIS.  This task is often used to delete old backup files and other ETL files that are not required any longer.  We’ll step through two methods.  First method uses a script task entirely for the removal and the logging events.  This method will also have some comments in for logging and using the FireInformation method to mimic the normal logging abilities of SSIS.  The FireInformation method didn’t provide much more of a performance boost so it wasn’t used here.  Second method uses a Foreach Loop Container, Script Task for logic and a File System Task for the delete event.  SSIS Logging will be utilized with the OnPreExecute and OnPostExecute events in the second method over the System.IO method of AppendText.
</p>
<p>
The use of System.IO in a script task performed much better than the use of the File System Task.
</p>
<p>
Both methods were tested on folders containing 300 files with size ranging from 200MB to 1GB.  168 files were placed among the 300 in order to meet the properties that will require a delete event to fire.</p>
<p>Deletion by System.IO and manually logging to flat files elapsed in 156 Milliseconds. </p>
<p>Deletion by means of a Foreach Loop Container containing a Script Task to validate the file meets criteria (File System Task is limited in doing that) and then the File System Task to force the delete took a whopping 3.962 seconds!</p>
<p>Have fun playing with this yourself and hope it comes in handy when you need to perform this type of task.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has other methods or improvements to these, please feel free to comment or start a thread in the LessThanDot SQL Server forums.

File C:TestDeleteSystemIOFile_20100603123001.trn Deleted on 6/4/2010 7:11:38 AM
</p></blockquote>
<p>compared to the SSIS logging method of</p>
<blockquote><p>Diagnostic,onpnt,onpnt,Delete Old File,{E4830550-A51A-46F3-A374-243888315707},{969D771F-24A9-4A57-B98D-42B025BE2573},6/4/2010 7:31:25 AM,6/4/2010 7:31:25 AM,0,(null),Trying to delete file &#8216;C:TestDeleteFileSystemTaskFile_20100603191001.trn&#8217;.<br />
Diagnostic,onpnt,onpnt,Delete Old File,{E4830550-A51A-46F3-A374-243888315707},{969D771F-24A9-4A57-B98D-42B025BE2573},6/4/2010 7:31:25 AM,6/4/2010 7:31:25 AM,0,(null),Finished deleting file &#8216;C:TestDeleteFileSystemTaskFile_20100603191001.trn&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
The use of the script task and going to the System.IO namespace to do the work has some benefits over the second method.  The largest was speed.  The second was the administrative and development time needed.  </p>
<p>Both of these methods are sound and good options.  The File System Task usage removes the need for more extensive programming over the Script Task.   There are also benefits in the logging method used and the amount of information we can easily obtain during the execution progress.  Picking either method will be decided on comfort level with coding in .NET and performance requirements while giving up or gaining functionality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
I will be speaking tomorrow night, May 4th, on SQL Server Integration Services basics for the SQL Connections group in the Chicago suburbs.  Yes, the Wisconsin guy is going to go farther than Hwy 60 once again.  The session, &#8220;SSIS 2008 Basics – Get up to Speed in 90 Minutes&#8221;, will be going over the fundamentals of SSIS and getting started with your own installation and development of packages.   There is a lot to cover when considering SSIS basics when starting from opening the installation media, to opening BIDS for the first time.  I hope everyone that attends leaves the session excited and ready to jump into SSIS.
</p>
<p>
The path and goals of the session will cover</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning and Installation Requirements</li>
<li>Developing a basic SSIS package</li>
<li>Importing/Exporting packages</li>
<li>SSIS issues to watch out for</li>
<li>Deploying an SSIS package to production</li>
<li>Differentiating various package storage methods</li>
<li>Running packages manually or on a schedule</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are new to SSIS or a seasoned SSIS developer/administrator, come out and join us.  Remember, SSIS is as powerful of a feature in SQL Server to developers and it is to database administrators.
</p>
<p>
For more details go to http://sqlconnections.eventbrite.com/<br />
<br />
Once the session is completed, I’ll upload the slides and accompanying package (with supporting files) to this post.<br />
<br />
See you there!</p>

The above quote from Alex Noble could not describe how I perceive the success of SQL Saturday in Chicago enough.  The day after the event I sat at my desk looking out of the window recapping the day.  I could still see Brent&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/brento">twitter</a>) Mac Book unguarded in front of me with evil thoughts going through my mind.  Sadly, the bids on Twitter were pretty low, making the deal not worth it.  I can see Wendy (<a href="http://wendyverse.blogspot.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/wendy_dance">twitter</a>) smiling as we passed in the halls and, even knowing we both wanted to stop to see how things were going, we knew if we did something would be delayed.  I can still see the look on Aaron’s (<a href="http://www.aaronlowe.net/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/Vendoran">twitter</a>) face when he realized a 30 foot VGA cord was needed to truly get Woodfield A setup as we needed it.  Yes, that cord was never found.  I recall the panic as I walked passed registration at 8:00 AM and the only thing missing were &#8220;people&#8221;.  That quickly turned to a new type of panic when, 10 minutes later, there were 100 people standing in line.  I chuckled then when I realized just how difficult it is to walk in on a speaker that I call a friend and have great respect for to give him the, “You need to stop!” look.  Thankfully, I’m still friends with them, even after that.   Last I recall walking through the halls from room to room making sure things were moving along while receiving great feedback from the attendees.  They were smiling and letting me know things were going really well.  Those appearing happy in passing kept me pushing on.

<h2>Measuring the event</h2>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/success_1.gif" alt="" title="" width="336" height="240" align="middle" /></div>
<p>So how did SQL Saturday in Chicago turn out?  I have a biased view on the success of this event of course.  I was one of the organizers after all.  What organizer wouldn’t just say, “Success!” and go on with life?  Well, I’m not that guy.  I measure myself on my ability to provide to the SQL Community.  Most of you reading this know me that way and expect nothing less.  I do think SQL Saturday in Chicago was a resounding success.  We had our bumps in the road but quickly picked ourselves up.  That was only possible because of the team we had.  At one point in the day, I ended up at the Office Depot across from the event, arguing with someone to get more session evaluations printed.  They insisted I said I needed them Monday.  After the event!  I could write an entire blog on that problem but will leave it for you to ask me directly in person.  I feel that since that was the prominent failure/problem/bump in the day, we can continue to come to the conclusion the event was well planned.  The vendors were happy, speakers had a good time, attendees were happy (most) and my co-organizers never seemed to have that frightened look in their eyes.  Can I call this a success yet?  </p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/success_2.gif" alt="" title="" width="375" height="255" align="middle" /></div>
<p>
Our lineup of <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/31/schedule.aspx">speakers</a> was remarkable.  Each one gave the event all they had and I’ll be in debt to them for that in the future.  During the after party events, I had several of the speakers come to me and congratulate me on the event.  Now if the speakers don’t complain and say you did it right, I’d call that a good thing!  They are of course the ones in front of the attendees the entire day and pulling in the feel of how things are going.  I was lucky enough to have a chance to talk to a few of our speakers on a technical level which is something you just don’t get to do on any given day.  I strengthened my relations with some and also earned respect from the speakers I had not met until now.  We’re getting close to success now!</p>
<h2>Vendors</h2>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/success_3.gif" alt="" title="" width="386" height="260" align="middle" /></div>
<p>
The layout of the hotel we used for SQL Saturday actually played to our favor very well.  We were able to place the vendors directly in line of the main speaker rooms from the registration tables.  This caused an influx of attendees directly interacting with the vendors.  Towards the end of the day I got feedback from the vendors to make sure things went well.  I was excited to hear that they had been equally excited and happy with the manner of interaction and marketing that had taken place for them.  I thank all of them again for supporting us.  </p>
<h2>Success!</h2>
<p>
OK, I’m going to say it.  Given the feedback, event evaluations, session evaluations and the sheer respect we (Wendy, Aaron, the volunteers and I) received from the entire event, I’m calling this a huge success.  Now that I’ve had a few days to sleep off the rewarding work, I even want to do it again as soon as possible.  Yes, those discussions have begun already so stay tuned for where you can find SQL events near Illinois and Wisconsin in the near future.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
I’ve said it, Wendy has said it, Aaron has yelled it (literally); nothing could have been accomplished without some key variables to this event.<br />
<br />
Volunteers: Wow, did the volunteers step up.  I honestly don’t think we could have done half of what we did without our volunteers.  I owe everyone a great deal and hope I have the opportunity to repay what they did to help us soon.  For all the volunteers that read this, take great pride and satisfaction in your hard work.  We received great feedback from the attendees on how well you managed the event.<br />
<br />
Our room support including, Wayne Gault (get on twitter and blog!), Tim Benninghoff (<a href="http://vsteamsystemcentral.com/cs21/blogs/timbenninghoff/default.aspx">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/bugboi">twitter</a>), Keith Mescha (<a href="http://kmescha.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kmescha">twitter</a>) and Bill Lescher were absolutely amazing at keeping things going.  All four of these individuals are an asset to the SQL Community and have my utmost respect.
</p>
<p>
The night before the event we had several volunteers come to our aid as well.  Tim Ford (<a href="http://thesqlagentman.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlagentman">twitter</a>)and Jason Strate (<a href="http://www.jasonstrate.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/stratesql">twitter</a>) came down to lend a hand which I am grateful for as well.  This led to the speaker dinner that also was a great success (minus the spaghetti orders).  Aaron and I didn’t stay long for the speaker dinner but heard everyone had a really good time.  I’m grateful to Confio for inviting us all and sponsoring the speaker get-together.  </p>
<p>Registration was, again, unbelievable in keeping the flow of attendees coming in.  Eli Weinstock-Herman (<a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;author=9">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/tarwn">twitter</a>), Jes Borland (<a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/grrl_geek">twitter</a>), Christina Leo (<a href="http://twitter.com/christinaleo">Twitter</a>), Aaron Nelson’s (<a href="http://sqlvariant.com/wordpress/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlvariant">twitter</a>) daughter, Dorothy and several others pulled it together like a smooth running SSIS import job.  They literally had the bull rush come at them but stood their ground and kept everyone coming in.
</p>
<h2>Closed book</h2>
<p>
I call SQL Saturday in Chicago a success and a huge accomplishment for me.  There isn’t one piece to the puzzle that is more important than the other.  I was able to take new friendships away with me and new thoughts on how I can help in the future.  Vendors, speakers, volunteers and attendees make the SQL community and events like this successful.  It may get old, it may get cliché, but I don’t care.  “The SQL Community rocks and is like no other”.  I am truly honored to be among all of you and be given the chance to give a little back to all of you.  </p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that helped and made working so hard, so easy!</p>
