				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Chrome for over a year now and have been very happy with it. Yesterday version 5 was released, you can get it here: http://www.google.com/chrome</p>
<p>I decided to look at some stats for this site and compared April of this year to April of last year. The image below has this information.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//BrowserPercentage.PNG" alt="" title="" width="592" height="756" /></p>
<p>As you can see FireFox lost about 10% while Chrome gained 9% and Safari gained almost 1%. So what is going on, are the early adapters switching to Chrome from FireFox? Take a look at the <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1">NetMarket stats</a></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//stats.PNG" alt="" title="" width="750" height="242" /></p>
<p>FireFox had 24.72% of all bowser traffic in November, in April it had 24.59%, FireFox didn&#8217;t gain anything in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>So what is going on? When Internet Explorer 6 was the dominant browser it was very easy for FireFox to grab market share. Internet Explorer 6 was a mess, Internet Explorer 8 is better but still not as good as either FireFox or Chrome in my opinion.</p>
<p>So what will happen to FireFox will they ever pass 25% or is this a downward spiral and within a year Chrome will have that 25% and FireFox will be at 15% or so? With all the new stuff like the Google&#8217;s App Store that Google is adding to Chrome its usage will have to grow fast.</p>
<p>What browser do you use and did you try Chrome and if so did you like it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to do a little test on one of my machines with the three browsers I use most. In each browser I opened up <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?tab=ym">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/?cnn=yes">CNNMoney</a>.<br />
I did this on Friday and did not look at the memory usage until Monday. After a little less than 3 days, we get the following numbers</p>
<p><strong>Chromium 1.0.154.48</strong><br />
180,157k</p>
<p><strong>IE 8.00.6001.18372</strong><br />
362,223k</p>
<p><strong>Firefox 3.0.4</strong><br />
100,148k</p>
<p>Looking at these numbers makes you think that Google wrote Gmail and Google Reader in such a way that it on purpose made Internet Explorer leak memory like a bucket without a bottom.</p>
<pre>If IE 
   then leak memory 
else 
   behave normally</pre>
<p>I don&#8217;t know but this is just crazy, don&#8217;t come to me either saying that IE8 is beta, so what, this is insane! IE8 uses 362MB while FireFox 3 only uses 100MB. Chrome compared to Firefox uses almost double the memory. Chrome + FireFox combine still use 80MB less than Internet Explorer 8</p>
<p>Below is a screen shot of what memory usage looks like</p>
