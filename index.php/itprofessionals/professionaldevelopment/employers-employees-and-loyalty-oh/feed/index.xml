		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if I agree with the implication of &quot;Those companies pay the salaries of their employees which should demand a certain amount of loyalty.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pay my local hot-dog vendor, should that demand a certain amount of loyalty from him?&lt;br /&gt;
I pay my plumber, should that demand a certain amount of loyalty, in the sense that it&#039;s talked in this article?&lt;br /&gt;
Why should the simple fact of paying for work put in some mandatory loyalty bond? The terms of transaction are my work for your money, other things such as loyalty, friendship, gratitude, etc are quite possible but optional.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Furthermore, loyalty to oneâ€™s own self-interest also&lt;br /&gt;
&gt; does not equate to disloyalty to external interests&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the usual me-vs-them dichotomy in these sort of conversations misses a larger point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans evolved for social cohesion;  we&#039;re hard- and soft-wired for cooperation, in the broadest sense of the word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of both parties (employers and employees) should be to maximize their mutual self-interest as much as possible.  Granted, that overlap will never be 100%.  But *so* many beautiful things of grandiose scale have been the result of people working together to grow their self-interest into something larger.  Partnership.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder how much of the perceived &quot;loyalty&quot; of baby boomers comes from the presence of pensions and/or salary adjustments that actually improved their standard of living?  These things were sacrificed at the altar of shareholder value long before I started working but I hear stories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that as companies provide no expectation of them being loyal to their employees, the expectation of employees being loyal to them is a laughable one at best!  Companies pay their employees for the work they do, and that&#039;s it.  If you are not loyal to another, it is immoral to think another should have loyalty to you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, there are a couple of caveats... Options and rsu&#039;s given to high performers is both an incentive for an employee loyalty and the incentive also for higher performance.  In this case, the company should expect loyalty up to the amortized market value of the incentive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is one more aspect -- that of personal loyalty.  There are some people that you know at work and you have become friends, and friends to the point that even outside the business environment, you have earned each others loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This personal definition is that of the current generation... And one that I prefer.  It is one that replaces impersonal relationships between a person and a be autocracy or company with a much better and more moral one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this definition, a person may be high up in a company and earn the loyalty and friendship of those beneath him, but that is a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
all this being said, perhaps it is time for founders to think differently... afounder may decides he wishes to build his company on mutual exchange of loyalty.  This company would have to have a completely different approach to hiring, employee retention and remuneration structure... I hope such a thing happens - it will make our world a better place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Corporations also had years if not decades to change.  People could and would change at that same pace.  This constituted a significant portion of a persons life.  Now corporations must change year to year...more often than not...quarter to quarter.  People have had to adapt to the rapid cycle.  I don&#039;t know if it is a question of loyalty or &quot;appearance&quot; of loyalty that has changed because of the acceleration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was something that should have been mentioned, too. I suspect most people would consider their loyalty to their employer as being defined through their boss rather than the corporation itself. I know that is typically the case for me, anyway. Thanks for pointing that out!]]></description>
