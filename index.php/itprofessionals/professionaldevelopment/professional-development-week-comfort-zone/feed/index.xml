		<description><![CDATA[Ted, very interesting points. I just wanted to introduce you to a web app that I have worked on, which you may find particularly interesting called What is My Comfort Zone (www.whatismycomfortzone.com). The web app allows you to measure and analyse your professional, adrenaline, and lifestyle comfort zone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That comfort zone is a big thing and not something to be taken for granted.  But learning how to take small steps outside of that zone is the only way we can grow.  I know that stepping out of that zone is challenging for me but it is the only way I can continue to improve and be able to do more.  Besides, having experts like you (and others on this site) makes it a little easier for me.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(And yes, I saw your earlier comments on &quot;experts&quot;.)]]></description>

This topic is one I love to talk about and really glad I can do it this week for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Ted and good points. Stepping outside of comfort zones is key to growth. I made quite a leap recently in my career going from DBA to BI developer. I&#039;m first one to tell you that the BI stack has always intimidated me for some reason so it&#039;s scary change but a good one. This shift forces me to learn and continue growing professionally and personally. Thanks for the great post and looking forward to rest of the week!]]></description>
