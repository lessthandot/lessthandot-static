		<description><![CDATA[Nice review! The best thing about this SQL Server MVP Deep Dives series is that it introduces you to things you didn&#039;t know existed. Many find themselves in AHA-moments when they come across solutions they did&#039;t think of. This book and all succeeding volumes are valuable to any SQL Server pro :-)&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good review. I always try to read as many books as possible on a subject, you will always find some interesting stuff and something you didn&#039;t know...even if it is the 20th book you read on the same subject....and since repetition makes perfect, the more books you read the more you will retain (hopefully)]]></description>
