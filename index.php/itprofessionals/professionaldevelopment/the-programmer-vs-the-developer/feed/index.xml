		<description><![CDATA[A Software Engineer sits in between a programmer and a developer (I am the latter).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Software Engineer does just that, engineers a solution - programming in multiple dimensions i.e. have a broader view of the architecture (but not necessarily the wider view of the Developer) but ultimately, still applying one important thing:  &lt;strong&gt;Precision&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Programmers are acutely precise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Software Engineers have a much wider scope but they still employ precision (&lt;em&gt;through the disciplines of Software Engineering i.e. Patterns &#038; Practices, Methodologies, Instrumentation [iteration, testing...]&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Developers have a much more abstract view of the solution, they are essentially floating above everyone else, able to visualise where a solution starts and where it may end.  Cause &#038; Effect, Political Waves and Geography (the lay of the land, where resources are, where to apply them etc).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an ideal world (my world), you would have on or two Software Engineers, several Programmers, one to three Developers and an Architect (or two) who provides overall governance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway I am ranting, this should be taken into the forum for a healthy chat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Great Post Eli!]]></description>

Useful definition breakdown, though. I&#039;m going to recommend this to a few people I know to help them understand what I mean when I say &quot;developer&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Job ads and job titles cannot be counted on to accurately represent what a business needs or expects. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love those jobs that require everything + the kitchen sink...how can you expect a person to know Java, Ruby, C#, C++, Python, VB, JavaScript, T-SQL, PL/SQL, Perl and know it well...this is impossible]]></description>
