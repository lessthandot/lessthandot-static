		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback Allan! I agree, only you know how redundant you need to be and my hope is that those who haven&#039;t thought about redundancy for their presentations will start to think about it.  It could be something as simple as copying it to a flash drive or it could be much more complex.

I usually travel with both my W530 and my Surface Pro and can usually do what I need to on one or the other if one fails for some reason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who has been doing this a long time, I agree with the overall premise. The Demo Fairy has not always been kind to me (see http://www.sqlha.com/2013/10/18/even-if-you-are-prepared-happens/) which in some way validates your overall purpose behind this post. I am a big fan of redundancy but as I talk about - how redundant do you really need to be? Only you know.

In many places I go or present, I do not have an Internet connection. Azure in theory is a nice idea as a backup, but in reality, not always usable or applicable. Instead of carrying a laptop, I find the small form factor PC (like the NUC or Gigabyte Brix) is a much better alternative. Or, you have a demo PC and the SFF PC (which is how I worked for a bit - proverbial separation of church and state). Some virtualization platforms (read: VMware Workstation) mean the VMs are totally portable, so if they are on an external drive, as long as you can reinstall the hypervisor, you&#039;re good. Hyper-V is not like that. So platform choice can play in here, too. I&#039;m not saying the use of Azure is wrong; it&#039;s not for some demos. It wouldn&#039;t work for a lot of my complex HA demos for various reasons.]]></description>
