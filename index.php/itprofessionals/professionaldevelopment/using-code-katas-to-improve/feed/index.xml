		<description><![CDATA[I think I assumed that people that didn&#039;t know what programming kata&#039;s were wouldn&#039;t have strong feelings about them :) However I probably should have taken a moment to explain what a kata is (purposeful practice) in this post, sorry about that.

		<description><![CDATA[I was turned onto code katas earlier this year as a result of a training class where the instructor strongly suggested we try it. While I freely admit that I only do them intermittently (though I may try to be more proactive now since I have moved away from programming recently), I found them to be useful for learning new things. Especially given as I typically only learned what I needed to get the job done (especially in the last 3+ years). Now, with the katas, I&#039;m more inclined to learn new things again and, as you pointed out, other than the time, nothing is really lost in trying them.]]></description>
