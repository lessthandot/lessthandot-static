		<description><![CDATA[This entire series can be taken for much more than consulting, of course.  I expected (hoped) this would be as useful for someone trying to decide to go into consulting, FTEs seeing how they can better the same stress or project level work better and anyone trying to better themselves in how they approach any day in this field.  The consulting &quot;beef&quot; will really be in the estimation and time management areas more than anything.  The estimation one should be fun.  That is always the gray area for learning as a consultant.  A lot of trial and error.]]></description>
