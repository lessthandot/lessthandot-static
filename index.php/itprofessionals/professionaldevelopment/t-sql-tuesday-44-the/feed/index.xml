		<description><![CDATA[Hey Koen great blog, time lost is one of the great regrets.  I had something like this occur, the first time I cannot remember how I spent my time (but it was not productive).  The second time around I used that down time to study for and get my SQL 2005 certifications.  To me that second chance was life changing :)]]></description>
