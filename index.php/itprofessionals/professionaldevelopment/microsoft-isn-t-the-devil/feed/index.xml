		<description><![CDATA[I said this on Brent&#039;s blog, but I thought I&#039;d paste it here, too in the rare chance someone doesn&#039;t also visit Brent&#039;s site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The best thing that ever happened to me was NOT being renewed as a Digital Media MVP in 2009(I used to be a SQL MVP but by some stroke of insanity I asked Microsoft if I could transfer my MVP to Digital Media).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was pissed at first as that same year my MVP Lead told me I was doing things that were way ahead of anyone else. Several of my sites crashed (I had no backups…horror) and a new Lead was re-assigned to me and I didn’t take the time to explain. Quite frankly I was in a personal economic tailspin and the last thing I cared about was the triviality of a Digital Media MVP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when I got perspective, I realized that I was FREE. I could now say “Microsft abandoned Silverlight” (gasp) or “I love ubuntu”, etc., etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being an MVP should not mean you are one of the few people that own a Zune, Kin, or say “Bing” when you really mean “Google”. It should mean what it says it means – you are a respected, recognized, credible expert that helps people. You shouldn’t have to leave your opinions at the door.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with both you and Brent (oh what a cop-out Denis)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answer as always is &quot;it depends&quot; If a company doesn&#039;t listen to internal communications then make it public, case in point is the securiry problem facebook had. It was disclosed nothing was done, after the &#039;hacker&#039; revealed it publicly by posting on Mark Zuckerberg&#039;s timeloon, facebook immediately was forced to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BTW your title should have really used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge&#039;s_law_of_headlines&quot;&gt;Betteridge&#039;s law of headlines&lt;/a&gt; and be &quot;Is Microsoft the Devil??&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I left a comment on Brent&#039;s blog, and I feel I need to make another one here, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While I love the MVP community, I feel they are the only ones with enough power to drive product decisions outside of Microsoft. If MVPs are tame, constructive criticism will never get to the PMs and middle-managers at Microsoft that can make a difference. I, for one, expect MVPs to be very vocal, even if their opinion is not popular. &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I had similar thoughts today as well: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Editorial/101453/&quot;&gt;http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Editorial/101453/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good post, Ted, and I agree. It doesn&#039;t make sense to rant and rave about issues, when there are more productive ways to make your point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took this differently than Brent. Pointing out flaws, or noting decisions seem to not make sense, as Brent did in his post, isn&#039;t flaming the product, development team, or company. Calling them (devs, managers, etc) stupid for not changing something is. All too often I do see people ranting or flaming and making it personal when it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s a business decision, great one or poor one, that was made. You can seek to influence, and you can do so loudly, but you don&#039;t need to do so rudely.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&#039;t write about this, but I wanted to mention one specific point here. You wrote that &quot;I still find it remarkable that some MVPs retain the MVP status while doing everything I just talked about without providing any helpful feedback instead of complaints or flames.&quot; As far as I know (which honestly isn&#039;t much), I don&#039;t think Connect suggestions factor into MVP status. The vast majority of MVPs I know have never entered a Connect suggestion.]]></description>
