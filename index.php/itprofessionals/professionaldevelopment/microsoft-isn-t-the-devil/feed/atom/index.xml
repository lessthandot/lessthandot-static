Few people in SQL world I used to follow religiously but stopped recently as I found in the end  (or anywhere) of every post there is one msg .&#8221; Move to some other db(postgres)&#8221; .most of the posts were pushing more negative thoughts and rant than any real help on the topic.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The best thing that ever happened to me was NOT being renewed as a Digital Media MVP in 2009(I used to be a SQL MVP but by some stroke of insanity I asked Microsoft if I could transfer my MVP to Digital Media).</p>
<p>I was pissed at first as that same year my MVP Lead told me I was doing things that were way ahead of anyone else. Several of my sites crashed (I had no backups‚Ä¶horror) and a new Lead was re-assigned to me and I didn‚Äôt take the time to explain. Quite frankly I was in a personal economic tailspin and the last thing I cared about was the triviality of a Digital Media MVP.</p>
<p>But when I got perspective, I realized that I was FREE. I could now say ‚ÄúMicrosft abandoned Silverlight‚Äù (gasp) or ‚ÄúI love ubuntu‚Äù, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>Being an MVP should not mean you are one of the few people that own a Zune, Kin, or say ‚ÄúBing‚Äù when you really mean ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù. It should mean what it says it means ‚Äì you are a respected, recognized, credible expert that helps people. You shouldn‚Äôt have to leave your opinions at the door.</p>

<p>The answer as always is &#8220;it depends&#8221; If a company doesn&#8217;t listen to internal communications then make it public, case in point is the securiry problem facebook had. It was disclosed nothing was done, after the &#8216;hacker&#8217; revealed it publicly by posting on Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s timeloon, facebook immediately was forced to take action.</p>
<p>BTW your title should have really used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge&#8217;s law of headlines</a> and be &#8220;Is Microsoft the Devil??&#8221;</p>

<p>While I love the MVP community, I feel they are the only ones with enough power to drive product decisions outside of Microsoft. If MVPs are tame, constructive criticism will never get to the PMs and middle-managers at Microsoft that can make a difference. I, for one, expect MVPs to be very vocal, even if their opinion is not popular. </p>

<p>Good post, Ted, and I agree. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to rant and rave about issues, when there are more productive ways to make your point.</p>
<p>I took this differently than Brent. Pointing out flaws, or noting decisions seem to not make sense, as Brent did in his post, isn&#8217;t flaming the product, development team, or company. Calling them (devs, managers, etc) stupid for not changing something is. All too often I do see people ranting or flaming and making it personal when it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a business decision, great one or poor one, that was made. You can seek to influence, and you can do so loudly, but you don&#8217;t need to do so rudely.</p>

<p><a href="http://ozar.me/2013/08/the-blogger-isnt-the-devil/">http://ozar.me/2013/08/the-blogger-isnt-the-devil/</a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t write about this, but I wanted to mention one specific point here. You wrote that &#8220;I still find it remarkable that some MVPs retain the MVP status while doing everything I just talked about without providing any helpful feedback instead of complaints or flames.&#8221; As far as I know (which honestly isn&#8217;t much), I don&#8217;t think Connect suggestions factor into MVP status. The vast majority of MVPs I know have never entered a Connect suggestion.</p>
