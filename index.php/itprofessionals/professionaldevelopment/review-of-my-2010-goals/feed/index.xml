		<description><![CDATA[Hi Denis,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
thank you for recommending my book (SQL Server DMVs in action), hopefully it will be available shortly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Might I suggest a non-technical book that you and others might find interesting.... It&#039;s called &quot;Blind Jack of Knaresborough&quot;, here&#039;s my amazon.co.uk review: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great read, irrespective of the type of book you usually read. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack was made blind at the age of 6, but he subsequently had careers as a guide, musician, soldier, trader, and most famously of all, a road builder. Additionally he has an `interesting&#039; personal life (e.g. got a woman pregnant while having another girlfriend, eloping with his true love, playing and winning at cards, brawling, and living to 92 years old) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is full of adventure, and inspiration. The author has done a first class job in making the life of Blind Jack available to a wider audience. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;
Ian&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
