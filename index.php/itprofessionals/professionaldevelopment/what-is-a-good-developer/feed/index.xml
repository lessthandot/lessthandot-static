		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more with this post, I have always seen myself as a developer in the truest sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion a coder is just what you described, very good at solving finite problems with clever solutions but they usually (almost always) have no concept of the bigger picture as they are very accustomed to working in a narrow focus (hence why code monkeys are good at producing small units of code to fix specific problems).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A developer is someone who has a sense of the bigger picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They not only understand the high level abstract view of the problems at hand (as a whole) but they also have a good understanding and awareness of the many different layers right down to the code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They will not necessarily know the specifics of a particular class that is required but they will have a sense of the requirements (so will know to a degree that a problem will need xyz pattern, will most likely make use of this framework and employ abc classes).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But a developer is a coder and more, someone who has a creative flair, visual memory and perception and will reflect on the bigger picture e.g:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;If we go with this solution, what impact will it have on the overall architecture, how will the business users respond..&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so on.  At the same time as a developer I like to take pride in what I am designing, it is art after all and presentation is everything in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For me the best developers are the ones who have wide range of skills and experience (from the hardware to the software), are able to think abstractly and can go way outside of the box when needed, but also able to communicate problems and solutions in human terms to the non techie world i.e. the business users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They in effect are the ones who lead the coders and guide them in the right direction, not necessarily senior coders themselves, they tend to float in the realm of architects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adios,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;Developers, as I envision them, do more than just code and not everyone can or should aspire to that. But developers should be used for more than just writing code and can only be better by learning and understanding more than just the code they read and write.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&#039;t agree more, Howard.  Great write up man.  And thanks.  Now that song will be stuck in my head for weeks!]]></description>
