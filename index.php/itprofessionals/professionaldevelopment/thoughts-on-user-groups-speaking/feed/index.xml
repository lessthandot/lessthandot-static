		<description><![CDATA[@Justin - Speaking is the best! We don&#039;t have a mailing list, so we rely on the face-to-face time at meetings. Personally, I&#039;d never volunteer anyone else to speak for something. Public speaking is such a deep-seated fear for so many people that I don&#039;t want anyone mad at me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is so true.  I work with the Minnesota SQL Server User Group (MNPASS) and we have seen speakes come up through our group over the years including Mr. Strate (@StrateSQL).  We have since started our local presenter offering which we have a lesser experienced presenter use 15-30 minutes to share with the group.  More users talking about what they do is AWESOME!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking is awesome. I got my start at LIPHP when a fellow member publicly volunteered me to speak on the mailing list. Have you ever considered actively soliciting a new speaker in that manner?]]></description>
