		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  I would say that stories like your tale of replication dlls and reading people like Paul Randal, Alan White, Jonathan and others inspires me to learn new stuff.  Sometimes that is self-study, but more often it involves talking to a networking, Windows or storage guy to learn something new.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why, surely you&#039;re not suggesting that the title makes the man (or woman)?! Sacrilege!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joking aside, I have more of a comfort level with people who&#039;ve come up through the ranks and learned the hard way, so to speak, and can understand why things work the way they do sometimes and, more importantly, can come up with viable solutions to resolve them. Well put, Ted!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree fully, the same is the case with the myriad of libraries that web developers use nowadays, you have to be able to find the bug in the library that you are using, fix it in your environment and then submit the patch or bug details to the developers of the library so that they can patch it. You can&#039;t just say jQuery or ExtJS has a bug and that is why the page looks screwed up anymore. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The same is of course true with stored procedures that you inherit/purchase, debug the code and fix it if the license permits it, otherwise contact the vendor and have them release new procs to you with the problem fixed&lt;br /&gt;
