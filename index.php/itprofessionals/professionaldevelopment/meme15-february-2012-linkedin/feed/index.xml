&lt;br /&gt;
If linkedin is facebook for professionals, then its best use for me is &quot;professional facebook stalking.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I use facebook in terms of friending my coworkers on it, as well as clients. However, that&#039;s administrata as far as I&#039;m concerned, it has no intrinsic value. The value is when I&#039;m about to get on a call I look the people on the outlook invite in linkedin. Are they employees or consultants? Does their experience list say technologists, or business oriented. Am I second or third degree from them, and through who? That way, if they prove to be difficult to work with on the conference call, I know which of my coworkers to visit and say &quot;just got off a call with $x, whats his/her deal?!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also hope people do the same with me. I&#039;m in more of a client facing position these days in a pretty much 100% Microsoft shop. However, personally I&#039;m all over the map in terms of platforms used and have been very heads down in the past. If a client wants to interface with our software with as IBMi (AS/400) for example, I&#039;d hope that the RPG dev on the first call would find my linkedin profile before the call, see that I started my career as a third shift iSeries operator, and know their not going to have to explain to me what a greenscreen is.]]></description>
