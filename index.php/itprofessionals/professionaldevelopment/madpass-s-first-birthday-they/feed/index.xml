		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great perspective, and for your tireless enthusiasm and great ideas on behalf of MADPASS.  We are pretty proud of MADPASS, and I look forward to many more years of innovation and camaraderie.  We&#039;ve accomplished so much in a short year, and I can&#039;t wait to see what we&#039;ll come up with next!  Cheers to the best PASS chapter in the world!  :)]]></description>
