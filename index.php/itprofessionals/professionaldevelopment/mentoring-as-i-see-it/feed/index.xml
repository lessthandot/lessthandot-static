		<description><![CDATA[Prakash - you raise an interesting question: how do you approach a mentor?  If you approach a complete stranger and say, &quot;I&#039;d like you to mentor me,&quot; you probably won&#039;t get a positive response.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As somebody who does a lot of mentoring, I can say that it&#039;s definitely a two-way street.  Before I begin a mentoring relationship, I want to see that the person has already taken initiative to contribute in the community.  That might be blogging, helping out in forums, speaking at events, answering #SQLHelp questions, or even just being part of a dialog on Twitter.  If someone hasn&#039;t done any of those things, I don&#039;t see them as really serious about giving back - only taking.  In that case, I personally say no.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;d suggest opening your requests by talking about the work you&#039;ve done so far for the community, and then ask for help taking things to the next level.  By laying out the work you&#039;ve already done, you can remind your potential mentor that yes, you ARE active even if they don&#039;t remember your name offhand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope that helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article, Ted! Over the years, I feel fortunate that I&#039;ve had several great mentors - including many members here on the LessThanDot community. As a result, I&#039;ve worked hard to be able to pass that knowledge on to others who were coming up when I could. It has always been an enlightening relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Justin, you can find them pretty much anywhere. In your office amongst your co-workers (which is how I started), in user groups (SQL User Groups), and even in the online medium on sites like LessThanDot (and others that are similar to this community). Find someone who knows more than you on a given subject or, for a mentee, someone who asks you questions is your opportunity to be that mentor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For mentors, twitter is an excellent resource.  You can slowly get to know people and the mentorship seems to just form from the social networking itself.  http://www.sqlpeople.net/ is an excellent resource and gives you insight to some of the SQL peeps out there that truly enjoy both sides.  Also, Steve and Andy started something a while back, http://thementoringexperiment.org/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other side, you really don&#039;t need to look to be a mentor or find one.  Social networking tools like twitter and other methods to get communicating with the community are the best tools and they land you in the situation.  I think we can all call ourselves mentors or being mentored at times :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other important factor is, don&#039;t be afraid or hesitant to contact someone that you think could help you or you can help them.  email, twitter, comments on blogs, events and IM all play into methods you can start talking with people on an individual level.]]></description>
