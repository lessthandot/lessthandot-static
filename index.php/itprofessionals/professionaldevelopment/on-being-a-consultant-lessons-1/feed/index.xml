		<description><![CDATA[I think you should consider yourself lucky that you were paid as a consultant to learn things you didn&#039;t know already.  It has been my experience that that doesn&#039;t happen very often (at least for those of us not with the huge firms).  If I were a company I would be leery paying a consultant to pick up a new skill that they implement for me, although a long-term consultant that had significant knowledge of my company&#039;s data and processes would change that equation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Best,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin&lt;br /&gt;
I hope the change to consulting continues to be a good one for you over the long haul!]]></description>
