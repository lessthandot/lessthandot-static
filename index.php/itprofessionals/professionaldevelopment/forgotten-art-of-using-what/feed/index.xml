I was way over the time I had allotted for the exercise and while I would have preferred to do it with powershell, I knew I could bang it out in a few minutes in VBScript (the limitation being my knowledge of powershell, not powershell itself).&lt;br /&gt;

That said, I also have a tendency to force myself to try new technologies or try to follow standards when I can, so I try to make sure my reasons are valid if I find myself falling back to an older technology in a pinch (and not just laziness on my part). You&#039;re either improving or sliding backwards.]]></description>
