		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Most of all how do we truly become advanced beyond our standings and know we still has further to go?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For me the way I&#039;ve grown throughout my career is never settling for ok.  I know there is always a better way to do something, or a better implementation of something I&#039;ve built.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This really kicked in a little over 6 years ago.  I worked in a shop where if a report finished in under an hour it was good.  That wasn&#039;t good enough for me.  I knew they could be better.  I pushed myself to learn indexing.  I pushed myself to learn SSRS.  That constant drive to be better, every day, is what keeps me going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know I&#039;ll be at this until the day I give up being a database professional.  But when that day comes, hopefully I&#039;ll have transitioned into a teacher, a leader, a resource, for helping others apply this same technique to their career.&lt;br /&gt;
