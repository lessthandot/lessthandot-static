		<description><![CDATA[Great post Ted.  This is what I wanted to say in my T-SQL Tuesday blog, but you word it much better.  I guess I skipped over the &quot;building a good base&quot; because I feel that most of us, as our route tends to be accidentally falling in to DBAness, build up that base as a matter of simply being tossed into the fire.  Thanks for putting focus on that, but also emphasizing the need for specialization to further your career.]]></description>
