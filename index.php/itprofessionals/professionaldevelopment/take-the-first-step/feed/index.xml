		<description><![CDATA[I could write a blog just on how you and the #SQLFamily inspired me years ago - and continue to do so every day.  Being more involved with PASS this year has been great  - 2014 is going to be even better.  Charleston.sqlpass.org (Charleston PASS User Group) is doing great - the new job that I took is great - and getting my boss to #SUMMIT13 this year has inspired him to start a User Group in E-Town KY!  Thank you - and Brent, and Jeremiah, and Kendra, and the entire #SQLFamily for helping me to take all of these huge leaps of faith.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cathrine - good luck with everything! Blogging is a wonderful way to share knowledge. Speaking is definitely scary, but remember this: everyone in the audience wants you to succeed. They are there to learn from you. You will do great! If I can help - let me know!]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for this and thanks for being the first to help me take that first step.  It&#039;s been a great three years.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting! Your thoughts and experiences sound very familiar - thinking I have nothing to say that&#039;s useful to others and being scared of presenting something that so many others know so much better. (And if that&#039;s not scary enough, English is not even my first language!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I did take that small first step and started a blog, I went to PASS Summit and met some wonderful people, and I&#039;ve signed up as a volunteer on my first ever SQLSaturday in 2014. I hope to take more first steps in other directions as well, and your post inspires me to just go for it. Thank you :)]]></description>
