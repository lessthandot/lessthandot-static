		<description><![CDATA[Amost everywhere I&#039;ve worked has had some form of time tracking software (all FTE jobs).  I never have an issue with them for 1 simple reason, log your time while you work!  As you change tasks log the start/end of the previous task so that you don&#039;t have to try to remember later. :)]]></description>
