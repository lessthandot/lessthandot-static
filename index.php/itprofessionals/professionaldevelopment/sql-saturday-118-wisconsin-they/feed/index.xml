		<description><![CDATA[Jes,&lt;br /&gt;
So glad to hear that your first event went so well. Sounds like you hit some of the same first-timer issues that we did last year. So, we need to find a better way to communicate our learnings. From what I&#039;ve read of our SQLSat107 (Houston) eval forms so far - it was a hit. But, the planning team knows all too well were we missed the mark - and you&#039;ll find that you are much harder on yourself than the attendees are. As several people remarked to me this weekend, they were pleasantly surprised at the quality of this FREE event. So now we&#039;ve raised their expectations for the next time! &lt;br /&gt;
Hope to see you are SQLRally or Summit! Keep up the good work! &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Mike Hillwig.  One idea and one person making the commitment for this event along with ALL of the volunteers making their commitment made this day happen.  After looking for people who do or are interested in sql makes a boatload of difference.  And finding so many people out there, given the opportunity to meet some people having an understanding is awesome!  Everything was great and learned a ton of stuff. also some stuff i thought i was doing properly but found inefficiencies.  I could go on but that is the sum of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank You, Thank You to all the volunteers and Thank You to the Sponsors who made the event possible.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jes, &lt;br /&gt;
Looks like your event went fantastic. I would have made it to yours but my Texas loyalty took me to Houston SQLSat which went very well too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree with all your comments. Also on the vendor 4imprint. They are simply the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Used them for 3 events and the 4th one on the horizon ( sqlrally ).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
