		<description><![CDATA[In answer to Karen&#039;s comments, if SQLSaturday organizers would use the Speaker Evals made available in the SQLSaturday admin site, those do not ask for the attendees name, so much like this past weekend in Madison, folks said what they felt on them. I wish events wouldn&#039;t use Speaker Evals for drawings, they should be using Event Evaluations for drawings. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone who doesn&#039;t have one of those, ping me, we have a great one available that Andy Warren created years ago.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[This is a touchy subject.  As both a speaker and organizer there is value in both options (triplicate anyone?).  This is the first one I got my evals back right away.  I found it to be helpful in two ways as a speaker - 1) I had some areas to work on and 2) I was encouraged by some of the attendees.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tend to agree with Karen about an approach.  We as speakers should let the attendees know that the feedback is going to the speaker.  They should feel free to not include their name. We would likely get some more feedback, good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As far as drawings, most of that is done with tickets from SpeedPass as opposed to evals.  The exception could be the event eval.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If one of the core goals is to help speakers grow, and that is clear, then give the feedback to the speakers.  As an organizer, frankly, it is one less activity that the volunteer team (usually worn out by then) needs to tackle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The biggest problems most SQLSaturdays have with speaker evals:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) Most are use for a draw, so attendees have to put their name and contact information on the form.  Most attendees assume, right or wrong, that these go to the organizers.  Most have not opted-in to having this information handed over to the speakers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2) Since attendees assume the ratings go to the organizers, they often leave comments that the never expect the speaker to see.  And yet the speaker sees them and knows who said it.  I&#039;ve seen many a speaker room where speakers are reading out some of the worst comments.  This is not good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3) As a speaker, I have no idea what&#039;s going to happen to the evals, yet I&#039;m usually the one passing them out and collecting them.  So I warn people that I might see their contents and that I might be given their contact information. Even if I ask before hand, the end result is often different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4) Both the organizers and the speakers should see the comments and ratings. The organizers should be using this as feedback for speaker selection.  Speakers want to see how they can improve. That does make more work for the organizers, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that speakers should get evals right away (if they want them), or at least have access to them after the organizers review them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I also think that speakers who are completely new, or unsure of their ability to present technical material to others (or who know they are not good speakers) should cut their teeth and build their public-speaking skills at the user group or other similar level first.  I think there is an expectation in the community that when you take time off on a Saturday to learn about SQL Server, often traveling a bit and incurring cost for that, that you will get good learning from the event.  No one wins when you have potentially scores of people a room and the speaker has poor material or just can&#039;t get material across to them.  Note that I am not saying a speaker or his/her deck has to be PASS-Summit-Polished to speak at a SQL Saturday.  My $0.047 worth...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, the evaluations are more for the speaker than the organizer.  Of all the events I have been at, I have only encountered one speaker that organizers felt should be banned from speaking again, it had as much to do with half the audience leaving the room due to the speaker not knowing his material and how arrogant and rude the speaker was.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have always felt that SQL Saturdays serve as an avenue to grow new speakers as well as provide a free source of training to local communities.  The socialization that happens is just a HUGE bonus.  If a presenter had a bad day, (was nervous, demo blew up, etc) they should not be banned from a future event and I don&#039;t think that experience should persuade a future organizer from selecting them for their event.  A means to protect other organizer from rude and arrogant speakers would be nice, but there might be some liability there.  Just my $.02.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Great post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Ted. It is easy to lose sight of the fact that SQL Saturdays should be a training ground for beginning speakers as well as attendees. If an attendee is unhappy with the quality of a session then perhaps they should be speaking?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I fully, completely, 1000% agree that SQL Saturdays are the place for local or inexperienced presenters to step out of the shadows.  You only get better with practice, and opportunities to get that practice are limited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting immediate feedback at the Madison event was huge for me as a first-timer.  It felt GREAT to get mostly positive feedback, and some of the critical feedback will help me to improve for next time.]]></description>
