		<description><![CDATA[I read this book and loved it, but I don&#039;t remember this part about charts and diagrams that you should know. And I&#039;m still sleeping well even though I know about only 4 of them!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Uncle Bob is overly strict about some things (no more than 3 function parameters, 20-line functions, etc.). I think his books are very instructive and valuable, and I&#039;d recommend them strongly, but you have to be pragmatic about his advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can still be a professional without knowing Nassi-Schneiderman Charts, and you can still produce clean code even if you have some 4-parameter functions ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;m with Chrissie - while I might use that kind of thing once in a while to help think something through, I can&#039;t recall the last time I did anything beyond a back-of-napkin type sketch.  I wonder if I might know what the others are if I googled them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My feeling has always been that if you actually have one of these artifacts (at least the ones I recognize) in front of you, it is probably already out of date.  I also haven&#039;t worked for the NASAs or Lockheed Martins of the world - I imagine in such environments this kind of thing is terrifically important but for the majority of actual work I&#039;ve done they would be massive time wasters.]]></description>
