		<description><![CDATA[Windows 7 will also let you create a shortcut for the snipping tool. If you right click the icon in start menu and go to properties you can define a global keyboard shortcut. I use Ctrl+F12 consistently on my systems. It&#039;s not quite as fast as SnagIt or Jing to come up, but it&#039;s handier then going and finding it each time you need it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great advice Ted. I have used Paint.Net for years too but something I got recently was Jing. Its from TechSmith - the people that sell SnagIt. Its like a trimmed down version that does screen grabs and allows you to edit/annotate them during the save process. You can also configure it to do short video captures of your desktop. I&#039;d recommend giving it a try. http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html]]></description>
