I agree with you, the reason an IT person can speak to a non-IT worker about the business is because &#8220;the business&#8221; is the common language they share.</p>

They should not be focus in managing their server alone, but teach other trustworthy people how to navigate their server system if one of the expert is not around.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/itprofessionals/projectmanagement/it-vs-the-business/#comment-5980"><![CDATA[<p>My favorite nugget in your article is right near the beginning where you said its ok for IT people to talk Business but not for Business People to talk IT.  </p>
<p>IT people must learn the business that they work for and how what they are working on will help or hinder it.</p>
<p>On the flip side, IT people should also be helping the business to understand IT and technology because they can come up with the most amazing ideas and solutions that we (IT folk) would never think of.</p>

As someone that just started a new job, it&#8217;s a perfect time to get to know the business.  And you&#8217;re absolutely correct.  You&#8217;re either engaged and adding value or not-engaged and can easily be replaced.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/itprofessionals/projectmanagement/it-vs-the-business/#comment-5975"><![CDATA[<p>So many great nuggets of wisdom here. Particularly great: &#8220;There are two types of workers, and they aren&#8217;t IT and non-IT, they are engaged and not engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The M.O. of a good IT department is to help the company solve business problems. Sometimes that means applying technology to the problem, sometimes that means talking a business person down from making an unwise technology leap, and sometimes it&#8217;s looking past the technology and assessing a business process.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for this fantastic post, Eli!</p>
