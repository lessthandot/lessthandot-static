		<description><![CDATA[My 2cents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consulting can be exhaustive and may involve quite a bit of travel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best part of consulting is the variety of configurations one can get to play, I mean work with.Also as a consultant youre always expected to solve problem which is a excellent exposure to learn things&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Alex brings up a point that I&#039;d like to address briefly. The sense of detachment from a project on the part of a consultant may be viewed as valuable because they are not invested in the current structure, but having been on the other side of that equation, it has too often led to a negative opinion by full-time staff who are left to work with an application built by consultants that may not do what it should or could be better but wasn&#039;t because the consultant wasn&#039;t as &quot;attached&quot; as the users. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While I do believe that good consultants (such as Ted here) can often do things that full-time staff simply don&#039;t have the time to do and thus serve a good purpose in the business, those consultants who come in proposing changes that may not actually make things better can be aggravating to the &quot;users&quot; who are invested in those applications. Just looking at the other side of the coin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ted, I agree with you on the ideas you presented above. The only thing I might have added is sensitivity to the staff who, in far too many cases, do not react well to the changes that the consultants will initiate. Change may be needed but that doesn&#039;t means it&#039;s always appreciated. Been there, done that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course!  What I meant is, *in theory* it would be nice to have an escape route if you got involved with a bad one - assuming that they exist (again, I must emphasize that I have seen no supporting evidence for this).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I find that consulting also gives you a valuable sense of detachment.  Because you aren&#039;t invested in their existing systems it&#039;s easier to see where things could be improved.  Then you just have to have to be sure not to make things worse ;)&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s kind of related to the compounding of skills (both come from the frequent change between projects) but another good thing is that if you get stuck with a difficult client it is only temporary - when the contract ends you are on to the next one.  If you get stuck with a bad company as a full time employee, your options to get out are much more limited.]]></description>
