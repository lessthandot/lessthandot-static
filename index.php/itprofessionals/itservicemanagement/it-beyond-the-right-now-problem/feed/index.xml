		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I think that one of the easiest ways to backslide when we do manage to start being proactive with risk management, technology selection, etc is that we get one of these projects done and then don&#039;t look at it again for several years. So you end up with a DR plan that fit the environment 4 years ago and hasn&#039;t worked since, backups that are not saving properly to tape, software packages that are 3 years worth of patches out of date, or developers using technology that is several years behind the competition and requires twice the effort to implement. Just because we clawed our way our of reactive mode once doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re done, it&#039;s very easy for a department to get complacent and end up back where they started.&lt;br /&gt;
Metrics, business visibility, and so on don&#039;t only help the business understand what we do, they should also help us maintain our proactive approach and outlook.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice Eli, I particularly like the idea of directly reporting the metrics for proactive tasks. Management often don&#039;t see these as real tasks because we don&#039;t report on them as real tasks that weren&#039;t done. But realizing that the last time disaster recovery was looked was in 2005 when we were at that old building may make some people realize it is overdue. It is not part of the backlog of things to do that we haven&#039;t done yet when it isn&#039;t even on the list of things to do.]]></description>
