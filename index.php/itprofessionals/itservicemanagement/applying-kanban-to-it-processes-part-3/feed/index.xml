		<description><![CDATA[Good question. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Basically the PC that cannot move forward is stuck where it is. Now this causes an initial minor delay but what it will actually do is start spacing out your imaging a little so that instead of imaging 3 systems simultaneously, you will start them separately (though potentially overlapping). This puts pressure on increasing the effectiveness of the step that is slowing down the process, either by adding more people or by improving the process. If you speed up the customization analysis process (ie, talking to customer) then you speed up everything behind that process too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we were talking about a later step (such as Office with 3), then the solution would be for whoever is roadblocked at the filled up Office step to either move forward to help clear the roadblock or move on to a secondary task. Continuing to build up partially completed inventory (ie, 6 more PCs with Office) basically just builds permanent extra delay into your process or builds a much larger delay for whatever comes behind the build-ahead you do, whereas going to help clear the blockage reduces the immediate delay and makes sure it doesn&#039;t project into the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another option would be to have the roadblocked person spend some time observing or focus on an improvement for the roadblocked step. If you continue to focus on the slow spots instead of trying to build as fast as you can in the easy spots, then your going to speed up or improve the quality of your whole process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit confused on something.  In your example it seems that their limits for imaging machines is 3, and customization analysis is 1.  say that a tech images two machines at once and there are no machines in customization analysis.  since there is only one slot in customization analysis, what do you do with the machine that has completed imaging but doesn&#039;t have a slot in the customization analysis section?]]></description>
