&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve read Peter High&#039;s World Class IT book. I totally agree on most of his premises especially the topic that talks about IT management tools and solutions. These software can really help enterprises to grow, be productive, and understand IT-business perspectives. IT management software can also help companies save money. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book also discussed some important points about investing on IT management solutions, which for me should be one of an organization&#039;s main plans. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Business and IT go hand in hand. In today&#039;s world, they need each other. When one fails, the other one will also not succeed.]]></description>
