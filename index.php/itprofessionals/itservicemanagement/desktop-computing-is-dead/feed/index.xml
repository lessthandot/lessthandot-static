		<description><![CDATA[I have mixed opinion about laptops. Being portable is fine. Small size is something you begin to appreciate over time. Ditto for power consumption. But uhhm most of laps have cr@p keyboard, 2-3 USB ports and cheap glossy TN/TFT display. So you end up with half dozen peripherals spread over the desk. That&#039;s how my setup at work looks like. At home, it&#039;s still good ol&#039; fat desktop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason for a desktop is simple. For $1300 in your example you get a laptop that can bet used as a solid development environment. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For $700 you can have a PC with the same. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would agree that the face of computing is changing. But I don&#039;t see the effect nearly so significantly for those of us behind the curtains. Yeah, it&#039;s handy to have a laptop, but at a fraction of the cost I can do the same work at my desk (which is where I&#039;m going to be working on the laptop anyway).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had multi-monitor on my laptop in 2008, maybe earlier. I had the laptop driving two monitors and a small tower under my desk serving up test VMs and driving a 3rd monitor. Compared to buying and supporting my own work super-tower or buying a not-so-hot one through a major manufacturer, the combination worked out pretty good at a similar price AND I could carry my main system out on the floor, to meetings, or home at night for support.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You starting trouble again?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Swapping out a hard drive/adding more harddrives,running quadcores and multi monitor support is the main reason I don&#039;t want a laptop as my main machine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We all get a laptop in addition to the desktop so unless you want to walk around with a laptop all the time the desktop is also a no brainer]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be willing to break away from desktop PCs altogether were it not for two advantages still enjoyed over laptops: ease of parts replacement and mutli-monitor support. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If my laptop mobo dies, I&#039;m in for a lengthy and expensive replacement process (assuming it&#039;s not cheaper to junk it). With a desktop, I order a replacement from Newegg and three days later I&#039;m back in business. Also, desktop video cards routinely have two video out ports, whereas laptops need extra hardware (docks, dongles, etc.) to add a second monitor and the process is often cumbersome. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until laptops can close these two gaps, I don&#039;t think desktop PCs can die off altogether, but you&#039;re right -- their advantages versus laptops are dwindling.]]></description>
