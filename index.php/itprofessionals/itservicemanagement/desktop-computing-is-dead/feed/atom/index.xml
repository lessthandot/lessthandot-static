Small size is something you begin to appreciate over time. Ditto for power consumption. But uhhm most of laps have cr@p keyboard, 2-3 USB ports and cheap glossy TN/TFT display. So you end up with half dozen peripherals spread over the desk. That&#8217;s how my setup at work looks like. At home, it&#8217;s still good ol&#8217; fat desktop.</p>

<p>For $700 you can have a PC with the same. </p>
<p>I would agree that the face of computing is changing. But I don&#8217;t see the effect nearly so significantly for those of us behind the curtains. Yeah, it&#8217;s handy to have a laptop, but at a fraction of the cost I can do the same work at my desk (which is where I&#8217;m going to be working on the laptop anyway).</p>

I had the laptop driving two monitors and a small tower under my desk serving up test VMs and driving a 3rd monitor. Compared to buying and supporting my own work super-tower or buying a not-so-hot one through a major manufacturer, the combination worked out pretty good at a similar price AND I could carry my main system out on the floor, to meetings, or home at night for support.</p>

<p>
Swapping out a hard drive/adding more harddrives,running quadcores and multi monitor support is the main reason I don&#8217;t want a laptop as my main machine</p>
<p>We all get a laptop in addition to the desktop so unless you want to walk around with a laptop all the time the desktop is also a no brainer</p>

<p>If my laptop mobo dies, I&#8217;m in for a lengthy and expensive replacement process (assuming it&#8217;s not cheaper to junk it). With a desktop, I order a replacement from Newegg and three days later I&#8217;m back in business. Also, desktop video cards routinely have two video out ports, whereas laptops need extra hardware (docks, dongles, etc.) to add a second monitor and the process is often cumbersome. </p>
<p>Until laptops can close these two gaps, I don&#8217;t think desktop PCs can die off altogether, but you&#8217;re right &#8212; their advantages versus laptops are dwindling.</p>
