In a software-as-service world, quality = customer satisfaction throughout the customer journey. That includes functionality, operability, ability to deliver new functionality (implies CI/CD are part of the thing being QA&#8217;d), as well as customer lifecycle aspects such as discovery, onboarding, support, etc. Ultimately QA can/should help the entire team focus on the entire service experience.</p>

Great opinions and I think we mostly agree on these. Some of the divergence is purely in the context of the points, but still great stuff. Thank you for taking the time to think about Quality vs. QA and respond.</p>
