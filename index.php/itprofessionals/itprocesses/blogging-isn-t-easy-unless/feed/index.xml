		<description><![CDATA[TED!!!!  Thank you.  :)  It is an honor to read your posts, and it makes me want to write my own thanking YOU, because for every post of yours I&#039;ve read, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve read two of mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I agree with Jes, it has been fun, and I have learned so much from you (and from Jes!)  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for always encouraging - not just me, but all those with whom you interact in the SQL Server Community.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&#039;t agree more on getting help. Every writer should have a couple people to edit them. It keeps us honest and motivated!]]></description>
