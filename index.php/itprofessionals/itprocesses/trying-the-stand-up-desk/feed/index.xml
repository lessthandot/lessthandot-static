		<description><![CDATA[Do you have any suggestions for a stand in a cubicle that is adjustable so when your tired of standing you can adjust the keyboard and computer down and sit. Most I&#039;ve seen are for desk and require too big of a mount for a cubicle. Thnx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently strained my back and am on doctors orders to stand while at work. I have been trying to look for relatively inexpensive methods of creating a standing work station. (currently I have my file cabinet in my cube with my computer on it. I love the pictures you posted and completely agree that standing while at work actually does make me feel more energized. Plus I am not in agonizing pain from sitting all day anymore. 

All in all thank you for the post and for the great ideas.]]></description>

For the sore-feet issue, I wear hiking boots every day. The extra support around the ankles makes standing all day easy-peasy.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Grats on taking the plunge.  You&#039;re going to love it,  but your first couple of weeks are going to be tiring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve been using a standing desk for about two years now.  Prior to that, I tried *and failed* a few times.  The things that lead me to succeed:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The height of the desk needs to be perfect.  If your wrists feel any sort of pain after a day at your desk, the height is off by as little as an inch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. You need a padded mat to stand on.  It substantially reduces the fatigue on your feet and back.  I couldn&#039;t stand all day until I got one, but now I&#039;m totally comfortable.  I purchased http://www.amazon.com/Sublime-Imprint-Anti-Fatigue-Nantucket-Cinnamon/dp/B003BYRDK2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1349627923&#038;sr=8-2&#038;keywords=standing+pad and it worked out well for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the detailed specs! I&#039;ll check it out at the local(wish) Lowes. Last week, I made a rough prototype with boxes to give standing a try for a day or so. I definitely felt much more focused and energized while working, but I think I&#039;ll need more raised platforms/space to give me more surface area for my usual workspace sprawl. Thanks, again, for the details!]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Still standing a year later? I&#039;m curious if people find standing sustainable, or if they go back to sitting after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;
