		<description><![CDATA[Glad to see you have upgraded! Having an adjustable stand up desk is the way to go. I commend you for lasting as long as you did with the fixed height and no stool. It would be tough for me to not burn out from standing so much right away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are hoping to get some anti fatigue mats in our office for everyone that uses an adjustable desk to use. You are right, the soreness never really goes away. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the update!&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Geek Desk owner here. If anyone&#039;s put off on the price, you can (hopefully still) order just the full mechanical base and put your own wood top on it. It&#039;s a $220 savings easily. And you can just use plywood (reinforce it if you like. It&#039;s worked fine, my top flexes but only when I lean on it. I recommend doing up the surface right with stain, poly, to make it finished for you. I used oak ply.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think with the standing desk, you need the pads that the barbers and checkout clerks often have. A cushy pad will help your feet. I don&#039;t have one, but I want one. soft slippers would work too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I probably switch my desk position three times every long work session and for shorter evening sessions (mine is at home) I usually keep it raised. Unintended benefit is the kid can&#039;t reach get to the computer stuff or my papers on my desk too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The motor is kinda loud but it appears to be a good mechanism. It&#039;s a pretty straight forward assembly but I think I would set aside a bit of time to be careful and get help if you&#039;re not inclined.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been standing for about a month at home. I mostly work at home, although 2-3 days a week I work at a client site where there&#039;s no alternative to sitting in a chair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The leg and back muscle soreness is gone now. But like you, I&#039;ve some discomfort in my feet, however it has decreased substantially in the last week or two. I deal with this discomfort by occasionally grabbing my netbook and relocating to a chair and footstool where I prop up my feet to give them a rest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first it felt strange to stand. For the first week I thought of giving it up, but that quickly went away as I realized that sitting was just a habit to overcome. Now I can&#039;t imagine going back.]]></description>
