		<description><![CDATA[Very nice post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Denis said it is really not possible to know all, however, it is not difficult to go to community and ask for more. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have realized many times, when I put something out, people help me, suggest me and guide me to become better. I wonder, people would have never helped me if I have not put myself out in community and shared my knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think excellent post and everyone should read it.]]></description>

I can&#039;t express how grateful I am to have the Twitter SQL community, the #sqlhelp hash tag, my user group, SQLServerCentral.com, LessThanDot.com, and the list goes on and on. I&#039;ve had a thousand questions and I&#039;ve never once felt &quot;stupid&quot; for asking them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very nice post. One of the saddest tragedies is people too scared to ask for help. Iâ€™ve always ascribed to the notion that at one time *everyone* was a beginner, and no matter how proficient everyone needs a helping hand on occasion. Being a librarian in the Library Automation field Iâ€™m constantly pulled in two different directions â€“ traditional responsibilities of being a â€˜librarianâ€™ and the database/SQL community. When needed Iâ€™ve asked questions of the SQL community and Iâ€™m so grateful for those that have helped, and continue to help me. They are wonderfully approachable with a fantastic enthusiasm to help! I always walk up and talk, and I thank everyone for being there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where was this three months ago when I needed it? ;) But seriously though, I have better luck of getting a reply when I DM @MidnightDBA than when I call my cable company. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks, good post.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Ted! Great advice on approaching folks. The experts in the community want to talk to you just as much as you want to talk to them. And like you mentioned, just the #sqlhelp tag on Twitter alone shows how much the community is eager and willing to help anyone out (unless they spam it with plagiarized content...).]]></description>
