		<description><![CDATA[You guys couldn&#039;t have done a better job.  I didn&#039;t hear a single complaint about SQLSaturday Chicago - other than the service at the speaker&#039;s dinner, heh, but that&#039;s WAY outside of your control.  It was a total success by any measure.  Congratulations!]]></description>
