		<description><![CDATA[This is a good post. I just disagree w/ the part that says &quot;They offer (mostly) unsolicited help&quot;. A forum afterall is mostly a place where you can ask, get, and plead for help--so the help&#039;s definitely solicited.:) I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s a typo error?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like this post especially the part about giving back. For me, the best thing about giving back is it forces you to review/research before answering to avoid giving false information. So you&#039;re right, you learn and re-learn. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have never been addicted to forums but hey, I need an addiction so maybe I&#039;ll try this out. ;) I&#039;d be the F5-addict (waiting for someone to just validate my oh-so-researched-response...do forum addicts people do that?)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know onpnt what would be a good idea (and maybe it&#039;s already planned and coming out this week)-- an article on community etiquette! Like &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) don&#039;t forget to say thanks &lt;br /&gt;
2) always play nice&lt;br /&gt;
3) make it easy for others to help you (ie, provide details)&lt;br /&gt;
4) don&#039;t be scared to admit it if you&#039;re wrong&lt;br /&gt;
5) don&#039;t gloat when you&#039;re right&lt;br /&gt;
6) don&#039;t call anyone stupid &lt;br /&gt;
7) don&#039;t call anyone sort of stupid &lt;br /&gt;
8) don&#039;t be mad when you&#039;re called stupid... etc etc. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think that would be a great and much needed post! Maybe next time? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good job on this! :) Looking forward to the next articles.]]></description>
