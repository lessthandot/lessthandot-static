		<description><![CDATA[Great job. Of course a good part of the problem is that in defining requirements, no one ever talks to an actual user. They talk to the managers of the managers of the managers of the users. A business analyst who has never talked directly to potential actual users is committing to providing a subpar product because the people giving the requirements are not the people who will spend their time entering data in it.   It is even worse when teh users are the general public like the people who shop on an Internet site. Then you have managers deciding what they think people might want without ever having talked to their typical expected customer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. Especially the part about the SDK&#039;s. I&#039;ve had similar thoughts on source control tools and other things written for developers as the end user. Just because programmers may be able to figure things out faster than an average user doesn&#039;t mean we should have to use bad software.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lespauled: I think there is a concept of &quot;good enough&quot;, but right now a lot of organizations treat usability as something separate from the product and as extra features, then say they don&#039;t have time to make a perfect product and will make something good enough (meaning they will spend less time on usability). My perspective is that you need to start with the user and add features with the user in mind. By default you then make something that does what a user needs, the question is then how long you spend making it really smooth for them, how many additional features you, and whether there is anything on the outstanding bug list that prevents it from being &quot;good enough&quot; for the user to get their job done better with the tool than without. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Howard: Thanks man. There&#039;s a great video from 2012 Business of Software you should watch on this subject and I keep forgetting to send your way: &lt;a href=&quot;http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/kathy-sierra-building-the-minimum-badass-user-business-of-software-a-masterclass-in-thinking-about-software-product-development/&quot;&gt;Kathy Sierra - Building the Minimum Badass User&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well put, Eli. I actually had something working along this line (though not exactly) but you&#039;ve put it much better than I could have. Software should be there to help us do things better and more efficiently. If not, then what&#039;s the point?]]></description>
