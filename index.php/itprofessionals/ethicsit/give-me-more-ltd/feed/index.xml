		<description><![CDATA[Finishing getting packed for SQLSaturday, going to be a fun trip. And if Chris keeps it up we might be staying up until 3AM in August, I was too easy on him last year. And yeah, Janice, the About Us page was my fault - I&#039;ll have to take a look when I get back and see if I can de-linkify them (or even remember how to edit that page).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whose idea then were the SSDs? ;) Re the Deep Dives book, I actually just ordered a copy from Amazon a couple of days ago based on your recommendation. It was cheaper doing that than flying to Chicago and attending SQL Saturday. But you have Brent Ozar speaking! I&#039;m a big fan! That would have made the trip sooo worth it--that and maybe winning an SSD :P &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Btw, on your About Us page, in the Owning Founders section, the names are made to look like links but they aren&#039;t. (How minute is that ;) Just saying :P)]]></description>
