We had a collegue with great knowledge about virtualization but he didn&#8217;t share any information with coworkers. So nobody knew the setup and configuration of the customer he was responsible for. Virtualization suddenly became very popular and the company decided to put a virtualization team together.

So somebody new was hired for the team leader job. I still remember the glaze stare in his eyes after his talk. Couple of days later we received a message that the guy wouldn&#8217;t come to work for some time, he had a burn-out&#8230;</p>
