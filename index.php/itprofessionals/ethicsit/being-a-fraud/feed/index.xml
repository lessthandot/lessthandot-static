		<description><![CDATA[Nice post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My experience as a self-taught has been ponctuated with this feeling of being &quot;less competent&quot; at times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve coded to solve problems for various people who would swear I am a genious and still I find myself feeling it&#039;s just bullshit and that there is so many better more talented, quicker, brilliant people out there. You know the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being a super autonomous person I often use the web as a source for many answers or pieces of information. In the RARE events I don&#039;t find any answer I resort to posting on some forums. Sometimes you come across those &quot;forum bullies&quot; who seems to enjoy the art of making ppl feel idiot. I find those stupid flame wars to be of the most childish egoistical practice on the web. I know some ppl don&#039;t really work hard at solving their own technical problems but this is even not a good reason to bash em publicly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The IT crowd can be so WILD at times. Intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of my biggest challenge is just to be permeable to this. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve grown with i guess, I feel vulnerable to it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You have an idea of the amount of vital energy can get wasted in such psychological struggle ? It really can engulf whats the best in you. Part of what makes us successful is our creativity, our capacity to be immersed in ourselves and surf of that nice creative drive. I think such feelings or doubts are of a nature that is the opposite of this creativity. This is toxic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I think &quot;fraud&quot; may have been to grab attention, but it&#039;s also not far off.  I like to learn and am far more aware of what I don&#039;t know, so sometimes it is difficult to keep perspective.  But that is also why I hang out with smart people (like on LessThanDot) - most of whom do not identify themselves as such - because I hope that I&#039;ll get something through osmosis.  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhenI was a child and I was starting to learn Chess. I was beaten all the time from the older kids. I eventually became frustrated and stopped playing chess alltogether. My father noticed this, he asked me and I answered him, he then told me this small tip:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to learn chess you have to play with those who can defeat you at it, because they know more than you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think your situation applies more or less to this tip. I&#039;m also a developer and struggling hard to keep up with all the new technolgies. Focusing helps master the technologies being used today,any attempt to keep up is just distracting. it is a paradox, and I think the best way is to define a priority per working week. 1 week you devote your self for learning new things, and 1 week to master the tools are using today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are still reading so far and still think you are afraud,You have to read about Dunning Kruger effect:&lt;br /&gt;
http://blog.maksoft.ch/2010/09/21/overrating-ones-skill/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Relax you are not a fraud. You just need to chnage your attitude by sticking around those who know more and passing your know-how to those who know less. and don&#039;t forget to give credit to those who know more and be gratefull that they share their hardly-earned-experience to you. &lt;br /&gt;
And never ever claim you know every-thing. There is nothing worst in the IT industry than those wan-a-bee jerks who claim they know everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The more you learn, the more you will realize how much you don&#039;t know.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would word this more as self-awareness and awareness of our field. Fraudulent has a negative connotation and I think most of us, if asked, are very clear about what we do or don&#039;t know, so it really comes down to our own perception of our abilities and knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we learn more, we expand that area of our knowledge, but also expand our awareness of what we don&#039;t know. The more we learn the more we find out is out there and the less we feel we actually know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t feel fraudulent because I have met people that truly have been filling roles fraudulently. People that because data analysts and would take their work home for spouses to work on or people that were interested only in getting the paycheck for the least possible amount of work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have interviewed many people with formal training and most of them don&#039;t know much either. Yes you need to know the basics, but the programming landscape is changing so rapidly that you need a person in a a parallel universe just to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you have formal training..if all you do is the same thing over and over, day in, day out, after a while you actually won&#039;t know the new stuff because you haven&#039;t been exposed to it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As long you don&#039;t see your job as a 9 to 5 job you should do fine, help people out in the newsgroups after work (that is how I think you will learn the most because you will encounter the problem that people have now and you might have in the future)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of watching reruns of your favorite shows read a good programming book or watch webcasts. When running listen to technical podcasts. Attend local user groups, they bring in people that present interesting material.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The time of being a COBOL/CICS/DB2/JCL programmer is over, you can&#039;t know everything anymore, this is why you see more and more people starting to specialize and focus on for example performance tuning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is always better to be in a team where people know more than you, you can learn from those people...when you are the top dog, you would need to mentor your co-workers. This is of course the reason you accepted your current position....you wanted to learn more and develop as a person and as a programmer&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
