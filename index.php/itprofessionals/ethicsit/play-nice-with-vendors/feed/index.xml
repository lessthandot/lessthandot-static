Thanks!  I compeltely agree on Red Gate SQL Compare as well.  I didn&#039;t think it was all that improtant to have over the years but last year requested to purchase the compare parts and it has been extremely useful along with saving a few mistakes that otherwise would ahve come up.  An awesome troubleshooting tool as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[George, knowing you personally and your abilities doesn&#039;t surprise me you haven&#039;t had a request for a change.  I still can&#039;t get over your objectives and goals before and after putting busboss and all your products over the years out.  Truly a vendor I wish I had the pleasure of working with.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I actually represent a vendor supplied databases.  In the 12 years we have been in business, not one single customer has suggested a database/table structure change.  Not once.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like to think that I would be receptive to a suggestion made by a customer.  This would be especially true with a more specific request (like adding indexes).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think it is important for vendors to realize that they don&#039;t necessarily know everything about how their systems are implemented.  They should be willing to be flexible enough to accommodate user requests (when it makes sense).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It stinks. In most cases you are at the mercy of the vendor to approve or even understand the issue.  A lot of times, especially with indexes you put them in and document the heck out of it and when it comes to upgrades etc. you drop them before upgrading and then add them post.  3 of the 4 business systems that I administer are that way.  One of them (ERP system) we have customized the heck out of it.  When we go to upgrade it later this year it will be a very time consuming process.  Thank goodness for Red Gate SQL Compare (insert plug here), it has definately been a life saver.  Great post!&lt;br /&gt;
