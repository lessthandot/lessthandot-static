		<description><![CDATA[Commodore 64, I was maybe 5 years old...playing Circus Stars and Steve Garvey Baseball!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad I had no clue in starting to code back then, I had the perfect machine to start learning with!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first system I had was an Atari 2600, but that&#039;s a video game console, not a computer. Then I got a Times Sinclair 1000, but I never had any really good games for that. Then I stepped up to an Atari 800XL. My favorite games were:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;br /&gt;
Autoduel&lt;br /&gt;
M.U.L.E.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I cut my teeth on a TI and Apple 2, eventually moving up to a Apple 2 GS and a Mac Classic. The first one I would really consider my own though, was a 386sx 25mhz. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Played all the PC classics: Secret Agent Man (SAM series), Commander Keen, Robinhood: Quest for Long Bow, Quest for Glory 1 and 2, Escape from Monkey Island. And plenty more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still think Quest for Glory 1 and 2, and Escape from Monkey Island are some of the best video games ever produced.&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Ah memories, my first computer was a Texus Instruments thingie, quite powerful however being young I killed it quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I missed the C64 (such a shame) and instead skipped over to the otherside with a ZX Spectrum (and later the 128+) - legendary games!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then came along an Amstrad CPC I inherited from a family member, what an awesome machine (still have it sitting somewhere in the attic).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then the mighty Amiga A500, I really got settled down on this wonder kit. Had all the custom bits (memory, drive) and lots of software and games (&quot;Shadow of The Beast&quot; anyone?^^), also the first computer where I learn&#039;t programming I think on something called AMOS? I still regret selling my Amiga...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After this I got hooked on consoles and still own the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SNES, Megadrive, N64, Dreamcast (awesome), Neo-Geo&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only consoles I play now are my PS3 and Dreamcast, DC because it still has some awesome titles and cool graphics (House of The Dead rocks!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They really don&#039;t make games like they used to...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First computer was the VIC-20 from Canadian Tire.  I still remember I had to take it&lt;br /&gt;
back 3 times to get a working one.  The count by scott adams is by far, on that computer, &lt;br /&gt;
where I spent countless hours.  Then after a long time I got the commodore 64c.  I stayed up for hours with friends &lt;br /&gt;
playing the Great American Road Race.  We pulled all nighters playing that thing, fun but what&lt;br /&gt;
waste of time, and a good waste of time that was.  Impossible Mission was another one as was Mail &lt;br /&gt;
order monsters and Racing Destruction Set.  Those were the most heavily played games on my 64. &lt;br /&gt;
Not to mention International Karate or yes Yie-ar-kungfu and Space Taxi.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today with emulators!  Wow!  I&#039;ve got some old computers I&#039;m setting up for games for my kids, &lt;br /&gt;
nieces and nephews.  All you need is an old computer, an emulator and a couple of game controllers.&lt;br /&gt;
You&#039;re all set.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way, I still have my old Vic20 and my commodore 64, those were the days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For anyone out there.  I would have to say the 2 best emulators out there are CCS64 and VICE.]]></description>
