		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re giving me more credit than I deserve on that one Chopstik (unless you also read the Developer vs Programmer post that&#039;s been sitting on the sidelines the last couple months). I wasn&#039;t trying to make any lasting points with this post, just make the announcement and do a quick jog down memory lane. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also I think it&#039;s important that we occasionally take time and look at some of what we have accomplished over the years (professionally and personally). I tend to be modest (or incredibly immodest in a sarcastic way) about my achievements and I have a bad memory. What this means is I often lose sight of the fact that I have had some really fun opportunities over the years. Sometimes we get so caught up in thinking about the future that we forget to reflect back over the successes, failures, and learning that we enjoyed along the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very enlightening post, Tarwn, and (unfortunately) one to which I can relate more than I care to think about. There is a big difference between a developer and a programmer (that&#039;s how I view this difference, anyway) and, like you, I have found that I prefer to be more of a developer with the varying roles and responsibilities tied to it. I thank you for giving words to something that I&#039;ve been otherwise unable to articulate very well.]]></description>
