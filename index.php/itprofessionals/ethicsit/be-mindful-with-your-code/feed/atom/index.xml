Very good point about not blaming it on the user. I always feel offended when after a blue screen, on the reboot I get told that I should use the &#8216;start&#8217; button to shut down the computer, not just switch it off&#8230; Am I to be a moron every time the OS crashes?</p>
<p>@Fadi &amp; Eli: <br />
When I was reading Fadis comment I was more thinking about 3 page error messages caused by template name obfuscation&#8230;</p>
<p>@Eli:<br />
Thank you for this splendid article. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m guilty of most if not all the bad things you mentioned, but nowadays I do try to avoid them, being well aware just how hard it is to read code, even your own, after some time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whenever I have to dig in some legacy code, I make a point not just to fix it, but also insert comments about what I&#8217;ve found, so the next guy coming to this place will have an easier time at it. In retrospect, that next guy is usually me, so I&#8217;m doing myself a big favor, in fact. :o)</p>

I agree, we tend to think purchased or Microsoft libraries should be the shining example, but that&#8217;s often not the case.</p>
<p>@Aaron: You should see the code for the LessThanDot site, PHP as written by a bunch of developers that rarely use PHP. Languages tend to have their own conventions, so beyond the general stuff, there&#8217;s often all kinds of conventions that really polished developers will use with a language that those not familiar with it wouldn&#8217;t even consider (like bootstrap files in PHP).</p>
<p>@mike: Good point on not blaming the user, I should have included that in the post. If anything, we should apologize that the user lost time/data/whatever in finding it, but also thank them for finding the issue, communicating it to us, etc. Whether it&#8217;s bugs, external dependencies, usability..something caused the user to go down a path we didn&#8217;t want them to go down and they have provided us an opportunity to make it better for future users.</p>

In my job, I&#8217;m sort of in the middle of the fray &#8212; I edit text, including UI text, including error-message text. Many times I&#8217;ve been handed error message to edit, and I&#8217;ll have to go back to the developer and ask &#8220;Can you tell me some more about what exactly is going on when this error message is displayed?&#8221; And  what&#8217;s surprising is how often that can lead to me eventually saying &#8220;So, what you just explained to me &#8230; can we just say that in the error?&#8221; </p>
<p>And double yay for noting that part of an error message should be a suggestion to the user about what to do next. If I&#8217;m a user faced with an error message, frankly, I often don&#8217;t care what the nature of the error is, really &#8212; I just want to know what I should do now. (Twitter and FB have been pretty good about this.)</p>
<p>Finally (sorry to carry on here), standard advice for error messages is to not blame the user, implicitly or explicitly. I still often see poorly phrased error messages. If the  POS card reader at my supermarket can&#8217;t read my card, it tells me &#8220;Bad card swiped.&#8221; This makes me all, like, screw you, you stupid machine, you&#8217;re the one that can&#8217;t read it. If nothing else, at least apologize to the user for the inconvenience of having suffered the error. ðŸ™‚</p>

Even after years of coding.  Mostly I think this is because I am always learning.  So the code I write today when learning a new language or concept, I look at in  months and realize I did it all wrong! </p>
<p>I will definitely be keeping this stuff in mind (moreso) now.  Good article &#8211; thanks!</p>

<p>If programming languages provided better error messages and better tracing, then programmers wouldn&#8217;t have to implement their own error libraries.</p>

I find that even now I find myself falling into bad habits or finding code from 6 months ago that puzzles me, but I think this is probably like professionalism, less a place we arrive and more something we have to keep striving towards.</p>

Nowadays, I find myself pretty annoyed when I see some of these practices and, if they are non-beginners, less patient with the developers themselves. Go figure&#8230;</p>
<p>Great post, Tarwn!</p>

<p>I wish every developer thought this way when coding.  My first gig out of college had me working on an old Clipper based system.  Most of the code was straight forward, but there was this one block of code that I considered &#8220;Magic&#8221; because it worked, but was impossible to understand, and equally impossible to modify.</p>
<p>Eventually it was necessary for me to modify this code (to add new functionality).  It took a lot longer for me to do this task than it should have.  A couple of comments would have made a huge difference.</p>
