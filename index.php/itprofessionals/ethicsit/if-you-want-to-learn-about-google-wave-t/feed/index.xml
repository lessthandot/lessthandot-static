		<description><![CDATA[Okay maybe I am stupid or something but I don&#039;t get this Wave thing at all....This is soooo confusing that even technical people have a hard time understanding this. What is the oint of this...we already have collaboration tools like Google Docs and Wiki&#039;s&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also think that Gina Trapani is pushing this on smarterware.org and thiw week in Google podacst so that she can eventually sell more of these books. She is the biggest Google fanboy I have ever soon...I mean come on...using an Android G1 (not the latest model) instead of an iPhone????&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just waiting for her Better Wave FireFox extension  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep..but it is still a work in progress&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
from the site&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This guide&#039;s web site launched October 31st, 2009, exactly one month after the Google Wave preview became available to a limited number of users. At launch, the guide contained eight fully-written chapters and two appendices (about 90 pages printed).&lt;br /&gt;
However, like Google Wave, this guide is an unfinished work in progress. With the help of volunteer contributors, this guide&#039;s contents will be written, rewritten, and refined in public on completewaveguide.com, as Google Wave changes and improves and rolls out to more users.]]></description>
