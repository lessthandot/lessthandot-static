		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...disregard the impossible and then, whatever is left, no matter how improbable or unlikely, is the answer.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s Arthur Conan Doyle&#039;s Sherlock Holmes, from &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, found in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. (Although maybe Spock or Data quoted him in an episode.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See Project Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1661&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the&lt;br /&gt;
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the&lt;br /&gt;
truth.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you wrote &quot;Somewhat exasperated and not a little sheepishly, I found a co-worker and walked through it on their machine&quot; it reminded me of probably one of the best debugging ideas I ever got:  the 15 minute rule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My mentor once told me:  &quot;Spend 15 minutes trying to resolve the issue.  If, at the end of that 15 minutes, it&#039;s not fixed, go get someone to look over your shoulder.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve found in most cases that the other person can almost instantly see the problem, saving me hours of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For me anyway, that old &quot;can&#039;t see the forest for the trees&quot; mentalitiy is coupled with a bulldog determination to find and fix it myself leading to a lot of frustration.  My mentor kept reminding me:  &quot;Don&#039;t let your bulldog bark overload your chihuahua programming skills.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I miss ya, Jim!&lt;br /&gt;
