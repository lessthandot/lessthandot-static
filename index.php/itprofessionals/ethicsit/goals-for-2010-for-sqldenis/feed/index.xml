		<description><![CDATA[Thanks....I do use MAME to play some of those old games...mostly Galaga, Xevious, zaxxon and Ghost N&#039; Goblins.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sure do miss the time when you could just pop in a game (LOAD,8,1) and type RUN  :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luckily some similar games can be played in the browser these days thanks to HTML 5, Flash, Flex, Silverlight and Shockwave]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice list, I need something similar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to the joys of Google I have virtually stopped reading books, merely flicking through them or in the case of fiction (not all IT books are fiction!), reading the first chapter, being utterly bored and putting the book down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For gaming I recommend going retro with some emulators and a stack of roms and you can&#039;t go wrong - I am still halfway through Super Mario World but the best bit is reminiscing as you flick through the titles and remember a time gone by.]]></description>
