		<description><![CDATA[Well, that is a one good article. i use forums to poast question rarely as most of the time i find my answers by simple search. but i think what i will do in future is i&#039;ll spare some time to help the community.  honestly, i wasn&#039;t giving too much back to community. your article made my mind, to live like a family and to contribute to build the community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[This is a nice list&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would probably add 2 categories to this myself&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Webcast/podcast/screen cast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because you know when you are on the go you can still get in some technical content and learn something. You can also do a lunch and learn at work and watch a webcast in the conference room with your co-workers while you eat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blogging&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once you start blogging you will be a better developer since in order to not get a bunch of comments telling you that your content sucks, you will want to make sure that you have researched your code and made sure that it is correct and performs well.&lt;br /&gt;
