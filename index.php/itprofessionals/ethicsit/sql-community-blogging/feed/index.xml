		<description><![CDATA[Hey Steve,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You bring up some good points I left out and should have made an effort to emphasize in this.  Blogging should be an extension of you as a professional and potential employers should be aware of that.  That leads to always being critical of what you put out there and the manner in which you do it.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Personal and professional blogs should always be separated.  Never let a professional blog tarnish your reputation by allowing personal feelings or hateful flaming out.  It does nothing but hurt yourself in the end.  The SQL community just isn&#039;t about that and why it is so unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I need to get to work on my first SQLServerCentral publication then, huh? :-)&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a slightly different take on blogs. I think there are people that are trying to teach others with their blogs. It&#039;s a publishing platform for them, and that&#039;s fine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However for most people, I tell them that the blog is their expanded resume. It&#039;s a part of their brand. It displays information about them. It&#039;s a good way to document, store, and archive your knowledge. And it&#039;s a good reference place to send potential employers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For people that want to be a leader in the community, using a blog is fine. I&#039;d rather see more of you publishing in places like SQLServerCentral, SQL Team, MSDN, etc. than just your blog. Unless you are blogging for your company, in which case it makes sense as a way for potential clients to find you.]]></description>
