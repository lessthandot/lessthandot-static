		<description><![CDATA[I understand that Bing is brand new and may evolve into something great or left on the roadside because it was run over by google, again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IMO Bing sucks when you are looking for answers instead of products.  Or why is every dataset they return based around my making a purchase?  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bing fails to get great answers on .NET and or tsql questions and the answers are in asp.net forum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
go figure ;-&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is young.  I&#039;ll give it time to grow or get aborted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you think that M$ is getting any revenue on sending users to sites as of yet?  Or will they just reduce license fees as a start?  Then introduce the pay me AGAIN AND AGAIN mantra.&lt;br /&gt;
