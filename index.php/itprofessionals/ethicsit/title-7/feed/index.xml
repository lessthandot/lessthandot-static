		<description><![CDATA[I doubt that something like Nazi Germany can happen again. There were many things perfectly aligned to give them power.&lt;br /&gt;
1)	Germany was in an economic mess, they had to pay enormous amounts of money to the French and others after they were defeated in WW1. They had hyperinflation that was so rampant in 1923 that prices doubled every hour&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
2)	Hitler was a very good speaker; he was very animated and drew the audience in. What was not known at that time was Hitler was an Amphetamine junkie and needed more and more speed to have the euphoria last, he also made some bad tactical decisions like operation Barbarossa because of that addiction&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3)	Joseph Goebbels was the master of propaganda, he controlled everything, radio, theater and newspapers&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nowadays you don’t really have countries that have such a control over all the media like back in the 1930s and 1940s. China is trying very hard with their Great firewall of China (also known as Golden Shield Project) and deep packet analysis of all the traffic.  People are using TOR (The Onion Router) servers and bypassing all of that. This is very much like the radio during WW2 when people would hide in a closet and listen very softly to banned station. During the cold war you had Radio Free Europe where people behind the iron curtain could learn the truth about their own governments&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is China going to do? Ban facebook, twitter etc etc etc. They might try but eventually hackers will always defeat the government because it is a cat and mouse game. Right now there are various tools like TriangleBoy, Gollum, picidae, Freegate and UltraSurf which do different things to bypass censorship&lt;br /&gt;
