&lt;br /&gt;
I think the other thing that should come into play is determination.  I have a problem with&lt;br /&gt;
people who only have a &#039;modular&#039; approach.  Sure your little piece of the puzzle is great,&lt;br /&gt;
but you have to be willing to see the entire picture and finish the project strong. No matter &lt;br /&gt;
how big or small it is. When your piece is only but a morsal of a bigger picture you shouldn&#039;t &lt;br /&gt;
be so close minded.  This is a hard quality to possess, but it goes hand in hand with trust.  &lt;br /&gt;
If I do not trust you to get the job done, your determination is probably low.]]></description>
