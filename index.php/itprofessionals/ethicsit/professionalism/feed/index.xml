		<description><![CDATA[Been in the same situation and I am in the same situation right now but I realised something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am more mature and level headed now, sure I still get aggressive but a little bit of positive aggression is good and sometimes it&#039;s good to challenge people to avoid working in an stale environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But you have to be diplomatic and know where the fine line is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Words are so easily misconstrued in an email or IM that it would be wiser to pick up the phone and make a call or take a walk to the persons desk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hardest thing to do is to remember everyone is different and trying to put yourself in their place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I always use the following mantra:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;There is someone out there who is even more screwed up than the person you are dealing with right now&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately the british healthcare doesn&#039;t offer any anti-pretentious-git lube but when it does, you will hear lots of pops going off as peoples heads are pulled out of each others backsides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Failing that do what opnt does - because revenge is bloody sweet sometimes!]]></description>
