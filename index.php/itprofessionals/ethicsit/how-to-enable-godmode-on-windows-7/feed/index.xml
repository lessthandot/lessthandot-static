		<description><![CDATA[To enable &#039;God Mode&#039; on Windows Server 2008X64, create a new desktop shortcut and under &#039;Type the location of the item&#039; copy and paste:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C:Windowsexplorer.exe shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then click &#039;Next&#039; and name the shortcut &#039;God Mode&#039; or whatever you want. The shortcut&#039;s icon defaults to C:Windowsexplorer.exe so you&#039;ll have to manually change it to C:WindowsSystem32imageres.dll(27).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to remove shortcut arrows from Windows 2008 icons:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

2. Extract the following files to a temporary directory:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
64-bit_Remove_Shortcut_Arrow.reg&lt;br /&gt;
Blank.ico&lt;br /&gt;
Restore_Shortcut_Arrow.reg&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Copy the file Blank.ico to: C:WindowsBlank.ico&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Right click on the file 64-bit_Remove_Shortcut_Arrow.reg and select Merge from the pop-up menu.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. A Registry Editor warning will pop-up, select &#039;Yes&#039; to accept the merge. Select &#039;OK&#039; in the confirmation message that follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. Log off and log on and the arrows will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I also had the same problem thatonpnt or Terry Tompkins and I had to solve it by using a KDE live cd... I don&#039;t know why but my safe mode dindn&#039;t work properly... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those who have the same problem as me and (luckyly) have a Linux Live Cd able, I&#039;m gonna tell how to fix the error:&lt;br /&gt;
  In my case, as soon as the disc booted I Dolphin, got in folder OS, and from there I got to the windows partition. Then just look for the folder &quot;Desktop&quot; and there you can erase the folder that is giving you problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry for my english... I come from Spain :-p&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can swear i don&#039;t have any idea on informatics, but I&#039;ve been a linux user for some years. I don&#039;t know if this will be very basic or elemental, but if it can help another person it&#039;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For all that may not know how to get into their machine by UNC (Universal Naming Convention) and have tried this on the OS listed that it causes explorer to crash, please follow these steps&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting into your machine by UNC basically means you connect to the admin share from another machine. This doesn&#039;t mean you need a domain setup internally.  If you are using a router at home, then you can do the same thing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you had a router in your house assigning IPs like 192.168.1.100, 192.168.1.101 etc...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You would connect to the C drive (admin share) of the computer that is having the problems (say it is the 101 machine) by doing this in the start--&gt; run&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
\192.168.1.101c$&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
you would be prompted for the local admin credentials.  More than likely you can enter what you use to log into the machine to get in.  Once you do that you go to &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
\192.168.1.101c$Users[your account]Desktop&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
then delete the folder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
once you do that, go back to the machine and hit the restart explorer message.  If that doesn&#039;t work refer to Terry&#039;s comment above.]]></description>
