		<description><![CDATA[I agree it looks interetsing, but I wonder if they have actually put it in front of a standard business user yet to see if that user can do their daily tasks or can find a way to use that dashboard view with their day-to-day work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suspect we (IT people) will be expected to make useful tiles for our apps. If I was a bi company I would be buying everyone Win7 phones right now to get them thinking about how to produce meaningful tile views into the data that would launch or drill into the main app.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although I think I would still want the ability to have small notifications around the edges, I&#039;ve gotten used to having small out of focus apps able to give me notifications through the taskbar and status bar without them using major screen real estate (like outlook or thunderbirds new mail icon). I can see these things even though I&#039;m working in a full screen app, without giving up an appreciable portion of my display.]]></description>
