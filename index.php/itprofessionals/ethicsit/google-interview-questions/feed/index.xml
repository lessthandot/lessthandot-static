		<description><![CDATA[#2 One solution is use unix sort and uniq. So on each server you put an 26 GB file. Sorting in memory is the fastest so you use unix split to make the files somewhat less than 4GB. Then sort each file. Concat the files and do sort so there is one file left. That will be the slowest part. Now you can do a unix uniq to get the counts. Then you move  the top 1M results with the counts from each server to one server. Sort by search terms, sum counts per unique search term, sort by count. Do a head -1000000 on the file.&lt;br /&gt;
I had an interview at google and had a similar question but they asked for the median number from the log recording search hit numbers or something. The interviewer didnt like my answer :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nr. 2 is a textbook example of a MapReduce. So I would either use their internal one (had I gotten the job ;)) or Hadoop. Creating an application which could be run in a cluster of 12 CPUs would be a breeze and the rest would be simply the logic behind report generation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From what I&#039;ve seen knowing a thing or two about their GFS and MapReduce is a must if you&#039;re applying for a SE position.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you look into a fully loaded, running blender, it makes a whirlpool with a toroidal flow that descends in the center and ascends on the outer portions (nearer the walls of the blender vessel). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, do whatever it takes to get yourself as high on the outside wall of the blender vessel as possible, with as much surface area as possible, to aid, catch and utilize that upward flow at the moment the blender starts. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the blades are long, and assuming you have had the presence of mind to start counting seconds from the moment you were informed of your putative last minute, I suggest standing on the outer tip of one blade and counting to 59 before jumping at the glass, and spreading out your appendages, fingers and toes, and any garments as much as you can. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Otherwise, just get as far up on the glass wall as your sweaty palms allow. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will only be aware of success.]]></description>
