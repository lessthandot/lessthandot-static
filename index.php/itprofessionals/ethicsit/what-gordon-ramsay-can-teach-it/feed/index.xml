		<description><![CDATA[While I agree with you, you have missed 2 vital points.  What you don&#039;t see it that Ramsey has some pre-conceived ideas about where it should go - and while these are based on his expertise &#038; experience of what works - it is about his leadership and vision, so all of these things work,but only because of HIM - if you don&#039;t have a visionary leader with a clear roadmap, all the commumunication in the world is not going to work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He also deals with the infrastructure - and puts his money where his mouth is re time and resource to get the kitchen right - buying new, cleaning up, taking time out to put that all in order.  He does not consult the customer on that and in fact CLOSES DOWN to achieve that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you on the American(FOX) version versus the BBC version.  The BBC show shows Chef Ramsay as a supportive, but strict person who only wants to make people be their best.  The american show edits most of this out, leaving us with only bleeps and anger.  His other shows, The F Word, and Great Escape show his curiosity, and competitiveness and desire to make everyday people better chefs at home.  Thanks for your insight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are so right!  Everytime I watch that show, I can&#039;t help but think the same thing.  Importantly is that someone stands up and says &quot;this is wrong&quot;, let&#039;s stand back and find out how to do it right.  Then do it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excellent Summary of the key elements needed in business.]]></description>
