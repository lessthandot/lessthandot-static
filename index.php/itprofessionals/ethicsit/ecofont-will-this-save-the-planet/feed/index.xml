		<description><![CDATA[I downloaded software from the Ecofont website and compared the print out with printing in grayscale. The ecofont print (i printed in the arial font) looked sharper compared to the grayscale output. When you put it under the magnifyer i noticed the holes in the ecofont print out varies in diameter and are exactly in the middle of the letter. In grayscale there were many little holes at a fixed distance. As a result the outline of the letter is not intact. I guess that makes the difference. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BTW I was supprised to see it works with normal fonts, I did not had to install the ecofont with holes.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I think that it boils down to this&lt;br /&gt;
use less ink--&gt;less cartridges needed--&gt;less times trucks have to deliver cartridges  to stores--&gt;less cartridges  have to be manufactured &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So you save in the oil that is used to ship the cartridges  and also oil used to create the cartridges since they are made of plastic...but HP won&#039;t be too happy probably&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But yeah, don&#039;t print and you even save more...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does any of you print doublesided?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point E.  I wasn&#039;t aware that ink was the thing killing our planet - if you want to save it not printing it out at all seems a better choice?  Or are the cartridges the problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t have a printer at home? How does your wife print coupons?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously, you&#039;ll likely need one as your children will need to write papers and print science projects, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As to the font itself: it looks like it would likely save ink. On the downside, it&#039;s not very readable. It&#039;s a noble effort, but seems almost silly in its execution.]]></description>
