		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe I read this just now. &lt;br /&gt;
Now everything about you makes sense. Thanks for sharing this. &lt;br /&gt;
Reading this while Looking back by Kerry Muzzey was playing on my iPod was such a bad combination :((&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Great story, Ted.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Sam!  I hope UC hasn&#039;t been that much of a problem.  It does make me feel good to hear others that have the same or very similar ailments are doing so well in life.  I&#039;ve met more than a few that gave up and let it consume them.  No way to live!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, thank you everyone for the great comments.  I enjoyed sharing this and having the opportunity to write it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SQLChicken on Twitter linked to this and I decided to read for...some reason. I immediately identified with the punk rock/skating/drinking part - I was never that hardcore or homeless, but I know the scene and love the music. However, when I saw that you have Crohn&#039;s, I knew exactly what you were talking about that it&#039;s responsible for you being where you are, because I have Ulcerative Colitis. Wrapping it up with your wife, well, I agree there, too (but, you know, about my wife;) because she helped me up so many times, and continues to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for posting this. Keep it up. :)]]></description>
