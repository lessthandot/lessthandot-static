		<description><![CDATA[This is the second recommendation of this book I&#039;ve gotten so I think I&#039;ll actually read it.  Although I would like to smart-ass critique some quotes: :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Simplify, simplify.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; How about, &quot;simplify&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;There‚Äôs not much to be said about the period except that most writers don‚Äôt reach it soon enough.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;  That&#039;s so meta!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This line struck a chord with me:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On unity: ‚ÄúEvery successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn‚Äôt have before. Not two thoughts, or five ‚Äì just one.‚Äù&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This immediately hit home with an example of Steve Jobs biography.  One part of the book talked about how A Players only like to work with A Players and that has stuck in the back of my mind ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I&#039;ll be picking up a copy of this book to read!]]></description>
