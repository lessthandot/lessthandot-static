		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I read a number of stories several years ago where someone found a surprise $20,000+ cell phone bill after their kid went on a school trip - literally just across the Canadian border, thereby activating roaming.  Their efforts to fight the bill were unsuccessful because, well, a contract is a contract.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AT&#038;T charges an insane amount if you don&#039;t opt-in to a monthly plan.  It&#039;s a horrible business model - the default action used to be that wireless carriers would charge the maximum, wait 30-45 days before informing the customer, and wham.  Only after the national media caught on did they offer the alert text that you got.  Imagine if you didn&#039;t pay attention to that message - or if you had Google+ or Dropbox auto-upload enabled for your new photos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
International travelers really do need to pay attention to this until carriers offer a default &quot;spending limit&quot; to stop losses.  I should be asked to confirm I really intend to spend more than, say, 200% of my normal bill.]]></description>
