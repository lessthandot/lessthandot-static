		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the excellent article. I was able to integrate Visual Studio Unit Test with Jenkins Build Server and look forward to reading further articles on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately there are not a lot of good resources on the internet and the book I have on Jenkins is even worse. Your article made a positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I see you are interested in Lean and Agile. 2 books I read recently make a very good read if you are business minded: Lean Start-up by Eric Ries and Running Lean by Ash Muraya.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am a newbie were CI in concerned but I am currently reading Ship It from The pragmatic Bookshelf which got me inspired. I am currently building a Build Machine with Jenkins which I am planning to use as well as other members of my team. After having implemented subversion version control last year this is the next step .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am also building a commercial software product with a partner and want to automate things as much as possible, including the packaging (creating an installer).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regards,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
