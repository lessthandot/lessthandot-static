<p>Thanks for the excellent article. I was able to integrate Visual Studio Unit Test with Jenkins Build Server and look forward to reading further articles on the subject.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are not a lot of good resources on the internet and the book I have on Jenkins is even worse. Your article made a positive difference.</p>
<p>I see you are interested in Lean and Agile. 2 books I read recently make a very good read if you are business minded: Lean Start-up by Eric Ries and Running Lean by Ash Muraya.</p>
<p>I am a newbie were CI in concerned but I am currently reading Ship It from The pragmatic Bookshelf which got me inspired. I am currently building a Build Machine with Jenkins which I am planning to use as well as other members of my team. After having implemented subversion version control last year this is the next step .</p>
<p>I am also building a commercial software product with a partner and want to automate things as much as possible, including the packaging (creating an installer).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Adrian</p>
