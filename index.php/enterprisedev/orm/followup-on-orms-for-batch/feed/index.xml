		<description><![CDATA[Excellent, thanks for that Luke. I&#039;ve been curious about that issue but my time has been split between too many other things lately to research it. I had a request via twitter to add Insight.Database as another micro-ORM, so you may see another pull request in the near future (it has some bulk logic built-in, so may be another contended for near-SqlBulkCopy performance).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those are some pretty awesome results on Simple.Data I think I&#039;m going to have to try it out. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &#039;Big &#039;Ol String method&#039; is actually a really interesting one, ive been meaning to blog on it as it appears that it exposes an issue in MSSQL with query plan efficiency on large queries. What makes this scenario particularly interesting is that when you have under 250 statements this performs really well and when you go over 250 statements there is a massive spike (ie 250 statements executes in ~160ms and 251 statements takes over a second) in the time SQL takes to generate a query plan. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#039;s some really interesting answers around this issue on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/q/10314528/1070291 and http://stackoverflow.com/q/8635818/1070291&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will post a little more around this soon as it intrigues me]]></description>
