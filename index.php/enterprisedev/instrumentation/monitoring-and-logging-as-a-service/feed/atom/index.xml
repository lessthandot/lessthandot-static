<p>Sorry to be so late to the party!  I just stumbled on your blog post and wanted to tell you about another logging service that offers unique capabilities to manage large numbers of errors while also providing efficient, scalable, centralized management of the detailed events leading up to each error.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/try/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/try/</a></p>
<p>Loupe couples local buffering of log data with a highly optimized synchronization protocol that allows thousands of events to be logged per second with no perceptable impact on application performance.  Our web UI makes it easy to understand which errors are having the greatest impact and to quickly drill down into the details that reveal the root cause.  This is complemented by a rich desktop log viewer with powerful highlighting and filtering capabilities that make it easy to isolate the sequence of events causing to hard-to-repro errors.</p>
<p>Both the logging framework and the desktop analysis tool are completely free.  Our log server is offered as a  subscription or may be licensed by customers who prefer to keep all their log data behind their filewall.  Free trials are available for either option and do not require a salesperson in the mix.  But, if you&#8217;d like a personal demo, I&#8217;d be happy to arrange that for you.  </p>
<p>We also have a video demo on our site:<br />

<p>Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
