Great overview, I&#8217;ve been looking for log management tool, the one we&#8217;ve selected eventually and is missing from your list is Stackify.</p>

<p>I love the run down you&#8217;ve done of the various log management tools.  </p>
<p>I work at Loggly and we&#8217;ve made a ton of performance improvements in the past few months.  We also do have some great visualization tools that you may have missed.  Check out the screencast on our support page: <a href="http://www.loggly.com/support/using-data/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">http://www.loggly.com/support/using-data/getting-started/</a> to give you a few ideas on what we can do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to clarify that only &#8220;Saved&#8221; searches are in beta; saved searches are just the shortcuts to searches that you run frequently.</p>
<p>Please contact me if you have any questions!</p>
<p>Thanks for publishing this,</p>
<p>Leila.</p>

We have received emails that they intend to start charging for the service in September with the lowest account level continuing to be free.</p>
<p>I also ran into an issue where multiple log messages sent via separate API calls would get combined into a single long message. It seems the way to prevent this from happening is to always start your log message with the time entry and to use one of the &#8220;type&#8221; codes and formats that they provide in the documentation (which I had assumed were just examples). I thought this was rather sloppy, since they are in effect combining things that are reported in separate HTTP API calls and should probably fix that logic, but that was the feedback I received.</p>
