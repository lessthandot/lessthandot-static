		<description><![CDATA[OK, yes, I understand. I thought MSDeploy just deployed the  zip package and that this package was created in the previous build stage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m copying the artifacts because I only build the code one time, in the CI step. Every other step then does additional testing or work on that one set of binaries, so there is no risk of changes sneaking in (either changes in system DLLs, .Net patches, dependent assemblies, etc). This also saves a small amount of time because I only do that build one time, then store and reuse the result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose for re-deploying the code is so I am always starting in a clean, known state and so other steps could run at the same time (although in this setup the load test step would really slow down any other steps that attempted to run at the same time from a parallel pipeline). I could also change the topology of my pipeline and make some of my steps parallel, so steps for the same pipeline would be able to run at the same time and reduce the overall lead time from code commit to delivery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hopefully that answers your question, but if I missed an aspect, please let me know :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
brilliant work. I was doing a similar learning on my own. I&#039;ve got a question. Why copying the artifact for the other stages and after doing a &quot;MS deploy&quot; of them? Why not doing just the deploy straight?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There wasn&#039;t an actual feature that supported me doing that, so it may be that that it no longer works. I haven&#039;t upgraded my server in a while. There is a bug specifically for this issue on the pipeline project (http://code.google.com/p/build-pipeline-plugin/issues/detail?id=54) and it might be that with the newer version of the plugin they solve this in another way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I never had a chance to test through using the Use upstream build that triggered this job&quot; option in the artifacts plugin, but you could store a file of common values that you want to pass downstream in a file that is in the artifacts and simply pull that in each time and read it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was probably one of the touchiest issues I had when building the pipeline and if I have some time I&#039;ll try to upgrade my server and see what happens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli,&lt;br /&gt;
I followed your posts about continuous delivery in order to configure a similar environment. However, I am not able to pass parameters from one job to another if the second job is not automatically triggered in the Build Pipeline, i.e. I am trying to reproduce a job similar to your QA Deployment Job, which is manually triggered receiving SOURCE_BUILD_NUMBER as parameter. I my case, the parameter has always the default value 0.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for any help,&lt;br /&gt;
