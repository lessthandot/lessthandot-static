		<description><![CDATA[TFS 2010 has come a long way now and is looking a polished product.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are using it quite heavily here now for our Agile based Web Development but also for other projects (like the one I am on where we need it just for the PM side).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have used the open source/php variants in the past you will recognise the portal features and reporting but it&#039;s nice to have it all in one organised place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I have found that you need to really embrace the whole Visual Studio way of doing things otherwise it is hit and miss (and that&#039;s where you would probably be better off with SVN or GIT).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still great to see MS take a step in the right direction - best way of combating piracy is to offer your products to your potential future customers and users.]]></description>
