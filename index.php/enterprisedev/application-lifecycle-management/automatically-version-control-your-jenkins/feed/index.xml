		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s no reason it couldn&#039;t be run more frequently (for instance, hourly, every 5 minutes, etc), although I agree this solution wouldn&#039;t work if you wanted to capture and commit each individual change. I haven&#039;t had the need to do that, so i don&#039;t know a solution from experience, but the two ways I can think of would be either to see if Jenkins exposes any events when it saves a job configuration or use an external program to monitor for file updates and trigger the commit. Or there is still the option of manually executing the commit. If you find a good solution for this with minimal external management I&#039;d love to hear about it, it would probably be abetter solution that the one I put together here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am interested in such a mechanism, albeit a bit more proactive.&lt;br /&gt;
Your solution will work if you change the configuration only once a day.&lt;br /&gt;
I would prefer a commit-on-change, like every time the configuration of a job or of jenkins itself is changed, a commit is done.]]></description>
