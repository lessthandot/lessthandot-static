		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli. Great article - thanks!
I am just getting started with using WCAT and I seem to be having some issues with cookies. All the documentation seems to suggest these are handled for us without having to do anything special but when I do a GET on a URL that sets a cookie (I can see it doing that through Fiddler) it doesn&#039;t seem to get remembered by the WCAT virtual client for the next steps in the Transaction. Can you think of any reason why or anything I should be doing to make that work?
Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t used it for HTTPS, but it is possible (and, oddly enough, is something I might be doing later today). From a brief look, it may be necessary o configure the protocol (TLS vs SSL3, etc) in order for it to work right, I&#039;m not sure if it will detect that automatically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Eli, first of all I´v like to say, that your article helped me a lot, however I have some doubts about it when it comes to an dual machine environment, what I wasn´t able to understand is if I have to install the controller in the server where my website is hosted or in the client machine, how can I do it? And what about the server, do I have to install it, how can I do that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I have my app, and wcat in the same machine, I´ve followed your instructions and it worked so far,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you in advance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
