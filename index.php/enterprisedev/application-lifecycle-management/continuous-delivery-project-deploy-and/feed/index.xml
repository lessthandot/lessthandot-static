		<description><![CDATA[I included a deploy step so I could perform the automated tests against a dedicated environment. In a real production system, you could have people actively testing whatever version is in QA but still want your newest changes to go as far as they could (including automated tests). Automated tests also run slower, so you might have newer changes coming in through CI and be ready to run through another Automated tests session as soon as the current one finishes. If one of the steps is frequently bogged down, it should help ensure as little downtime as possible between that step finishing and the next set of changes being available to run the step again.]]></description>
