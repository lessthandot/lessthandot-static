		<description><![CDATA[I had another set of scripts for TeamCity where I needed credentials passed through (Jira ticket integration). I ended up just adding two parameters to the powershell script and passing through the TeamCity tokens to use for HTTP auth (which shoudl be good enough, given that it&#039;s a local call to itself).

See this section of the docs: https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/REST+API#RESTAPI-RESTAuthentication - %system.teamcity.auth.userId% and %system.teamcity.auth.password%

I vaguelly recall also using the internal URL rather than hardcoding the domain in yet another place, as they reference in that same section:  %teamcity.serverUrl%]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent script. I&#039;m a little to this party, but I&#039;m finding the warnings very useful. I seem to be unable to make the prior warning comparisons work, as result of being unable to authenticate correctly with Teamcity on the WebClient DownloadString call (Exception calling &quot;DownloadString&quot; with &quot;1&quot; argument(s): &quot;The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.&quot;).

I&#039;ve using default credentials, and even supplying a username/password. Since this post doesn&#039;t mention anything like that, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s a configuration issue on my side?

Not a huge problem, the warnings themselves are still present, as is the report). I&#039;ve just disabled the comparison with prior builds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately I didn&#039;t write it, so it&#039;s slightly harder to debug.

I recall I did run into some errors before I got the paths correct, but I don&#039;t recall if it was specifically that one or not. One troubleshooting step i did ahead of time was to write-host the same line I was executing to call the report script to make sure I was calling it with the file paths I thought I was (this may seem silly, but it turned out I was not, the first time around). On my system, the script lives outside my code repo on my E: driver, so the exact code for my build step is (my working dir is not set, so it&#039;s the root of the repo):

if(test-path E:\Documents\BuildWarningReportGenerator.ps1){
   E:\Documents\BuildWarningReportGenerator.ps1 -BuildLogPath &quot;%teamcity.build.workingDir%\%BuildLogFile%&quot; -BuildCheckoutDirectoryPath &quot;.\&quot; -BuildArtifactRepositoryUrl &quot;%teamcity.serverUrl%/repository/download/%system.teamcity.buildType.id%/&quot;
}

Another option would be to add a Write-host prior to that line to see why it thinks the parameter is null (my guess is it thinks $newWarning.Key is null?)]]></description>
