I ended up just adding two parameters to the powershell script and passing through the TeamCity tokens to use for HTTP auth (which shoudl be good enough, given that it&#8217;s a local call to itself).</p>
<p>See this section of the docs: <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/REST+API#RESTAPI-RESTAuthentication" rel="nofollow">https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/REST+API#RESTAPI-RESTAuthentication</a> &#8211; %system.teamcity.auth.userId% and %system.teamcity.auth.password%</p>
<p>I vaguelly recall also using the internal URL rather than hardcoding the domain in yet another place, as they reference in that same section:  %teamcity.serverUrl%</p>

I&#8217;m a little to this party, but I&#8217;m finding the warnings very useful. I seem to be unable to make the prior warning comparisons work, as result of being unable to authenticate correctly with Teamcity on the WebClient DownloadString call (Exception calling &#8220;DownloadString&#8221; with &#8220;1&#8221; argument(s): &#8220;The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.&#8221;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve using default credentials, and even supplying a username/password. Since this post doesn&#8217;t mention anything like that, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s a configuration issue on my side?</p>
<p>Not a huge problem, the warnings themselves are still present, as is the report). I&#8217;ve just disabled the comparison with prior builds.</p>

<p>I recall I did run into some errors before I got the paths correct, but I don&#8217;t recall if it was specifically that one or not. One troubleshooting step i did ahead of time was to write-host the same line I was executing to call the report script to make sure I was calling it with the file paths I thought I was (this may seem silly, but it turned out I was not, the first time around). On my system, the script lives outside my code repo on my E: driver, so the exact code for my build step is (my working dir is not set, so it&#8217;s the root of the repo):</p>
<p>if(test-path E:\Documents\BuildWarningReportGenerator.ps1){<br />
   E:\Documents\BuildWarningReportGenerator.ps1 -BuildLogPath &#8220;%teamcity.build.workingDir%\%BuildLogFile%&#8221; -BuildCheckoutDirectoryPath &#8220;.\&#8221; -BuildArtifactRepositoryUrl &#8220;%teamcity.serverUrl%/repository/download/%system.teamcity.buildType.id%/&#8221;<br />
}</p>
<p>Another option would be to add a Write-host prior to that line to see why it thinks the parameter is null (my guess is it thinks $newWarning.Key is null?)</p>
