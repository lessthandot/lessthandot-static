		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately I was so burnt out just getting the plot to work that I never returned to try and do anything more advanced with it. More recently I actually have been working more with TeamCity instead of Jenkins (I re-implemented most of this multi-post project in TeamCity: &lt;a href=&quot;/index.php/EnterpriseDev/application-lifecycle-management/custom-charts-in-teamcity&quot;&gt;Custom Charts in TeamCity&lt;/a&gt;). Given how painful I found the plot plugin to be in Jenkins and how long it&#039;s been since I worked with it, it&#039;s unlikely I&#039;ll ever return to try to get any additional use out of it beyond what I figured out so far, sorry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article!&lt;br /&gt;
Have you managed to get the URL generation (on-point-click) working for the Plot Plugin?&lt;br /&gt;
The doc says: &quot;Optional. If set, this url is used when you click on a point. This is used as the base url for every point, %name% and %index% will be replaced in the url with the column name and index.&quot;, however %name% and %index% are not replaced here with indices, I am not sure if I hvae missed some step...&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!]]></description>
