		<description><![CDATA[Great article, but a point about Acceptance Testing in general:

&quot;Now this probably sounds like enough to go ahead an implement it, but lets nail down some scenarios first. If I was an working with an end user, these are the type of things we would probably come up with:

When I have nothing in my cart, it displays a total of 0
When I add an item to my cart, it displays a total of 1
When I add two of the same item to my cart, it displays a total of 2
When I add two separate items to my cart, it displays a total of 2
When I have two items in my cart and I remove one, it displays a total of 1
When I have two items in my cart, after I checkout it displays a total of 0&quot;

This isn&#039;t really what I&#039;d expect to see in an acceptance test; it&#039;s functional testing and should be pushed down the stack. Acceptance testing is expensive and should be used sparingly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Markus

Is there a way to use Nunit to create separate tests using different parameters for the same journey?

ie. same scenario in the feature file but a different test using different input parameters. MSTest allows the different tests to be listed but NUnit doesn&#039;t.

Regards
Ricky]]></description>

Please suggest

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli, really like this series of articles, I&#039;ve recently been doing something similar though using bamboo rather than Jenkins and AWS elastic beanstalk for production, it&#039;s interesting as you can push your changes to a load balanced cluster. We have been splitting our spec flow tests by entity which is quite close to page. I&#039;d like to draw your attention to coypu which compliments spec flow from a UI perspective. We also created a mock repository layer to ensure that when we ran the tests we could be sure of the state the data was in. I hope this info is useful to you. Andy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
   I really liked the way you are doing. How can we handle multiple browser testing means any point of time single instance of Web Driver should be invoked depending browser  browser i provide since i need to integrate with CI.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
     Please share.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Eli, this was a really great post!&lt;br /&gt;
You mentioned that one possibility for organising your step definitions would be to group them by the page they interact with. I was wondering, if you go this route perhaps you could make the base test class generic and specify the page object type as the generic parameter.&lt;br /&gt;
That way you could make the CurrentPage property typed and avoid the casting.. although your .As method certainly makes the casting more readable. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again for a great post!&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Great Post Eli, very helpful indeed! (I&#039;m working through all your Selenium and CI blogs)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One question concerning real world deployment. In order to do integration tests on my website I need to have different scenarios in the database, which requires adding and removing records to setup the required data. Given that tests should be able to run in any order, how do you best recommend resetting the database between each test. Also, do I do the given stage (&quot;given there are 3 records&quot;) via a direct call to the database, and then use selenium to browse the site with that now ready?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[@Markus: Thanks, I&#039;m glad you found it useful. My BeforeScenario and AfterScenario calls are defined in the base class and my step files inherited from that base class, so this looks like multiple BeforeScenario definitions to SpecFlow. SpecFlow treats these hooks are global, so in most situations you would use tag filtering to limit which hooks it calls. Given the inheritance model I was using would still end up having the same hooks called multiple times, I added the workaround to artificially limit it to one browser and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#039;s more information on the hooks and using tags for filtering here: https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/wiki/Hooks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
great work! Helped me a great deal to jump-start our UI-Testing framework.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;
Markus&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PS: Do you happen to know why the BeforeScenario()-Methode &quot;fires&quot; multiple-times per Scenario? To prevent Firefox to open multiple-times you added this code that looks to me like a workaround. Or is it a feature ;-) ?]]></description>
