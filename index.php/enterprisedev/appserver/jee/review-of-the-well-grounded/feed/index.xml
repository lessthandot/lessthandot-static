		<description><![CDATA[Quite a thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We reviewed it on TheServerSide as well, giving it 9 out of 10. It did make us start wondering what else they might put into a second edition. After reading it, did you find there were any items you would have liked to have seen included? If Martijn doesn&#039;t include some info on Android in the next edition, we&#039;re going to have a word with him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please share your thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been working through this book myself, about 1/3 of the way, and so far I agree with what you&#039;ve written: this is an excellent book. I find it at least as interesting and well-written as Effective Java (2nd ed).]]></description>
