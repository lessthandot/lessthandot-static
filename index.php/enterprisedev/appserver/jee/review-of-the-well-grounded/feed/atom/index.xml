<p>We reviewed it on TheServerSide as well, giving it 9 out of 10. It did make us start wondering what else they might put into a second edition. After reading it, did you find there were any items you would have liked to have seen included? If Martijn doesn&#8217;t include some info on Android in the next edition, we&#8217;re going to have a word with him.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts:</p>
