				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s PASSMN User Group meeting will be held on Tuesday, February 17th at 4PM at the <a href="http://binged.it/AcUxYj" target="_blank">Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) in Edina</a>.  This meeting is being sponsored by our friends at <a href="https://pragmaticworks.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Works</a>.  A huge thanks to PW for their generous sponsorship!</p>
<p>PASSMN is excited to open the monthly meeting with a short talk from Tony Malarz on using Ola Hallengren&#8217;s scripts.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Ola Hallengren Scripts</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Ola Hallengren scripts cover backups, index and stats maintenance, and checkdb. This will also include an explanation of how Tony has integrated the suite into the maintenance routines at multiple sites, plus the use cases for when the suite is (and maybe isn&#8217;t) a good fit. And it fits into any budget: it&#8217;s free!</p>
<p><b>About Tony Malarz:</b> Tony is a SQL Server DBA with 19 years experience in data management and development, dev group management, infrastructure, ERP, and compliance. He has kept the data flowing in industries ranging from collectibles to biofuels, groceries to HVAC.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The featured presentation for the evening will be from the owner of <a href="https://pragmaticworks.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Works</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianknight" target="_blank">Brian Knight</a> (<a href="http://blog.pragmaticworks.com/author/brian-knight" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/brianknight" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).  Brian spoke to a capacity crows at PASSMN two years ago and we expect another full house on the 17th!</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Creating Actionable Intelligence with Power Query</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Learn how to make BI really work for you with Power Query in Excel. In this session, you&#8217;ll see how to make business intelligence truly actionable for your end users by mashing data together that might seem unrelated at first. You&#8217;ll find out how to use the Power Query platform to take data from tables in websites and mash it with data in proper relational databases. Then, see how to present the data to end users with Power BI.</p>
<p><b>About <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianknight" target="_blank">Brian Knight</a>:</b> SQL Server MVP, MCITP, Brian is the owner of <a href="https://pragmaticworks.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Works</a>, the co-founder of SQLServerCentral.com, JumpstartTV.com, and was on the Principal Board of Directors of the Professional Association for SQL Server (PASS).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2012, as my tenure on the PASSMN Board of Directors began, it quickly became apparent to me that &#8220;our little club&#8221; was quite fortunate. It was rare for us to have difficulty finding speakers or sponsors and when it came to SQL Saturday, the generosity of our sponsors allowed us to do great things. Tack on the fact that we would routinely pull in 40-60 attendees per meeting, and we were living the good life.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, as I prepared to take over as Chapter Leader, I had a conversation with our outgoing Chapter Leader, Steve Hughes ( <a href="http://dataonwheels.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/dataonwheels" target="_blank">t</a> ) about a truly awesome idea he had come up with. In a nutshell “what if we were to setup satellite user group meetings in various locations throughout the state?”</p>
<p>What a great idea! Starting and nurturing a new user group can be an overwhelming task, but we could use the resources of PASSMN to help make this happen in other areas of the state. Minnesota is a big place, but strangely we only have two PASS Chapters, both of which are in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area.</p>
<p>The moment Steve mentioned this, I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of and I have focused a great deal of energy on it over the last year. We knew we had interest from people outside of the Twin Cities area and soon focused our efforts on Rochester, home of the Mayo Clinic and a large IBM facility. Rochester was also the location from which we would receive the most &#8220;feedback&#8221; when we were unable to stream a PASSMN meeting.</p>
<p>Getting all of the logistics in place took a little longer than we thought but I am thrilled to announce that PASSMN will hold the first ever PASSMN &#8211; Rochester meeting on January 22nd at 4PM, at the Mayo Clinic. Come for the networking, stay for the presentation!</p>
<p>A huge thanks goes out to Steve as well as a great group of DBAs at the Mayo Clinic and our Microsoft partners who all helped make this reality.</p>
<p>PASSMN will be using some of its cash reserves to sponsor the meeting and will be handling all logistics, as if it were just another monthly meeting.  Provided we have the interest, the goal is to host these meetings quarterly, while working with local SQL Server professionals to spin it off as its own official PASS Chapter.  Based on our early registration numbers, I am quite confident the interest is there.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re taking PASSMN on the road!  If you know anyone in SE Minnesota or Western Wisconsin that may be interested in attending, please have them <a href="http://bit.ly/1cPK4TJ" target="_blank">RSVP</a>!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to introduce a group of SQL Server professionals to the PASS community!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, let me assure you that I did not fall prey to some sort of SPAM.  I know as I write this that we are approaching mid-November, not a time when Microsoft awards/renews MVPs.  October 1st however was a different story.  As a whole, October was an extremely busy month for me and as I prepare to attend my first MVP Summit next week, I have been taking some time to reflect on what a bang it started off with!<br />
<br />
<b>Did That Really Happen?</b><br />
<br />
Although I had known since about the middle of September, it all became real about mid-morning on October 1st when I received the official email with the subject line &#8220;<b>Congratulations 2013 Microsoft MVP!</b>&#8220;.  </p>
<p>So me, a Microsoft SQL Server MVP?  To be honest, it’s still a little weird to say and even weirder to be introduced as such.  I knew that I had been nominated and had already been through a number of award cycles without hearing from Microsoft.  My nomination was not something I shared with anyone other than my wife, and although it sounds cliché, it really was an amazing honor to have just been nominated.  When I looked at the list of current MVPs and those who everyone thinks are/should be, well, it is humbling to even be thought of in that same light.</p>
<p>When I was contacted over the summer by Microsoft and asked to submit a list of my community activities, it was fun to revisit all of the great opportunities I’d had over the last year to work with and provide opportunities for others within the SQL Server Community.  I also found it a bit of a challenge.  I really don’t like talking about myself and anything that feels like self-promotion makes me uncomfortable.  Now don’t get me wrong, I love to talk, just not about myself.  So, in sticking with that theme, I want to take a moment to focus on those in my life who helped make this honor possible.  Yes, I did the work, but not without some key people by my side and a group, that through their actions, help set the standard for community involvement.<br />
<br /><b>Some Influential Folk</b><br />
<img style="float: right;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/mndba/OtherSQLFamily1.jpg" width="150" height="96" alt="" /><br /><u>My “Other SQL Family” </u>– I would not get to do the cool things I do without the support of my wife Jen and two young boys, Darren and Joe.  They get me. It’s that simple.  Knowing that I love my work with the SQL Server Community, they support me unconditionally.  Upon arriving home from PASS Summit 2012, I found them at baggage claim, holding this sign.  They are that awesome. </p>
<p><u>A Unicorn and a Teacher </u>– I first met Jason Strate (<a href="http://www.jasonstrate.com/" target="_blank">B</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/stratesql" target="_blank">T</a>) in 2011 during his final year as Chair of PASSMN, a position I would one day hold myself.  I met Sarah (<a href="http://sarahsjolander.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">B</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Dancem0m" target="_blank">T</a>) a few months later during my first SQL Saturday volunteer gig at SQL Saturday 99.  Jason sets a great example of what it means to be an MVP and together he and Sarah personify <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SQLFamily&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#SQLFamily</a>.</p>
<p><u>The One and Only Jimmy May </u>– When it comes to all things SQL Server, Jimmy (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimmymay/" target="_blank">B</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/aspiringgeek" target="_blank">T</a>) is one of the most passionate people I have ever met.  I don’t think he does anything at less than full speed x50.  That passion and energy are contagious!  Little did I know as he helped me, and the rest of us, understand partition alignment a number of years back, that I would one day call him a friend. Thank you Jimmy for all that you do.</p>
<p><u>SQUEEEEEEEEEE </u>– Little known fact, but SQL Saturday 149 would not have gone as smoothly as it did without Jes Borland (<a href="/index.php?disp=authdir&amp;author=420" target="_blank">B</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/grrl_geek" target="_blank">T</a>). I was a first year PASSMN Board member, planning a huge SQL Saturday, in a new location, on a new day.  Needless to say, my stress level was a little high.  Having just gone through something similar, Jes’ offer to be a sounding/venting board (in addition to delivering two sessions and sitting on the WIT panel), helped keep me sane.<br />
<br />
<b>Time To Wrap This Up</b></p>
<p>There are many other people I could add to this list, but think I can summarize it best by saying the SQL Server Community is the best, most supportive technical community there is.</p>
<p>I now commonly get asked what I am going to do to stay an MVP.  I haven’t given it a lot of thought and not sure that I will, but I would assume the answer is &#8220;more of the same&#8221;.  Sure there will be a little more of some things and maybe a little less of others, but I remain committed to giving back to this community that has given me so much, regardless of my award status.</p>

<p>PASSMN is excited to welcome Minnesota and <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/" target="_blank">SQLSkills</a>&#8216; own, Joseph Sack (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/joe/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/josephsack" target="_blank">Twitter</a>)! Joe is a SQL Server MVP and SQL Server 2008 Microsoft Certified Master.  Before his time with <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/" target="_blank">SQLSkills</a>, Joe worked for Microsoft as a Premier Field Engineer and managed the SQL Server MCM program. We are extremely excited to have Joe speaking this month and are expecting another overflow crowd!</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Performance Issues and Patterns &#8211; Joseph Sack</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> While a SQL Server professional may encounter various one-off situations over the course of a career, there are also several shared patterns and scenarios.  In this session we’ll walk through a few of these patterns interactively – where I’ll reproduce the issue and we’ll work through the scenario until we get to the root cause.</p>
<p><b>About Joe:</b> Joe Sack is a Principal Consultant with SQLskills. He has worked as a SQL Server professional since 1997 and has supported and developed for SQL Server environments in financial services, IT consulting, manufacturing, retail and the real estate industry.  Prior to joining SQLskills he worked at Microsoft as a Premier Field Engineer supporting very large enterprise customer environments. He was responsible for providing deep SQL Server advisory services, training, troubleshooting and ongoing solutions guidance. His areas of expertise include performance tuning, scalability, T-SQL development and high-availability.  In 2006 Joe earned the “Microsoft Certified Master: SQL Server 2005” certification and in 2008 he earned the “Microsoft Certified Master: SQL Server 2008” certification. In 2009 he took over responsibility for the entire SQL Server Microsoft Certified Master program and held that post until 2011.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/239/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/files/9898da7a-81d6-475a-95e5-717dcfe41329.jpg" align="left" alt="" title="" /></a>One week from now I will be arriving in Iowa City to kick off my <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/239/" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #239, East Iowa</a> experience!</p>
<p>I am honored to have been selected to speak at this event and am very much looking forward to it.  I have never been to the East Iowa SQL Saturday but everyone I know who has, simply raves about the manner in which it is run.</p>
<p>I will be presenting <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=239&amp;sessionid=15737" target="_blank">An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL</a>.  If you would like to learn about one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server, I&#8217;ll be in Room 2520B starting at 4PM!</p>
<blockquote><p><b>An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL</b></p>
<p>Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS. However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case. After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server. We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate. Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!</p>
<p><b>Session Level: Intermediate</b></p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to my session, take a moment and check out all of the other <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/239/schedule.aspx" target="_blank">great topics</a> being presented throughout the day.  I am thrilled to see strong <a href="http://minnesota.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PASSMN</a> contingent on the schedule!</p>
<p>East Iowa will be the last stop on my 2013 Upper Midwest SQL Saturday speaking tour.  So far this year I have spoken in Minnesota, Madison, Chicago, Fargo, and now Iowa City.  It&#8217;s been a busy couple of months, but an experience I would not trade for anything.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re local, or in the surrounding area, I hope you&#8217;ll take advantage of this great free training opportunity!  I hope to see you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the many things that I enjoy about serving as Chapter Leader of <a href="http://minnesota.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PASSMN</a>, is the opportunity to bring in a nationally recognized speaker for one of our monthly meetings.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image_block"><a href="http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2013/04/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-41-presenting-and-loving-it/" target="_blank"><img style="float: left;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/mndba/TSQL2sDay150x150.jpg?mtime=1365522663" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></div>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think my first blog post on <a href="http://lessthandot.com/">LTD</a> would be for a T-SQL Tuesday, but this month&#8217;s topic was so timely for me I had no choice but to participate.</p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t know, T-SQL Tuesday is a monthly blogging event, with a different community host each month. This month&#8217;s host is <a href="http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2013/04/t-sql-tuesday-41-how-i-came-to-love-presenting/">Bob Pusateri</a> and the topic is all about presenting. It just so happens, I&#8217;ve started doing a bit of that lately!</p>
<p>So, how did I come to love presenting? I starting doing it. It sounds so simple, right? Well, let me assure you, it was anything but.</p>
<p>Those of you who know me, know that I am not often at a loss for words and the term loud has been used to describe me on more than one occasion. I have an extrovert streak in me, but that only applies if I know you or I am <strong>quite </strong>comfortable in the group setting I am in. I was never driven towards public speaking when in school and it was not something I pursued on my own.  These are both things that I now regret.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years I have been making a conscious effort to expand that extroverted streak and have become something of a compulsive volunteer. I am in my second year on the <a href="http://passmn.org/">PASSMN</a> board, during which time I have planned a SQL Saturday and now serve as Chapter Leader, which yes, includes some monthly speaking duties. I have volunteered in other capacities for PASS as well. Despite all of this, standing up in front of a large group, and putting myself out there to be knowledgeable enough to instruct others, was never something I had an interest in doing.  If push came to shove, it was something I could do.  I did not have a debilitating fear. I simply lacked the initiative/proper motivation to take those next steps.  So what helped changed my mind you ask?  This community.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate to be introduced to many, what I consider to be great, speakers over the last couple of years and many have shared stories with me about how they started out.  To my surprise their stories mirrored mine.  Is it possible that these experts were once in my shoes? Indeed.</p>
<p>Then came a couple of personal interactions, with current speakers, which turned the tide for me.</p>
<p>At SQL Saturday Portland 2012 I hung out with Jason Horner (<a href="http://twitter.com/jasonhorner">t</a>) a good deal.  Yes, I survived. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  I&#8217;m not sure if he remembers this but he asked me twice &#8220;if you were going to speak, what would you speak on?&#8221;.  He was a speaker at the event.  This definitely got me thinking and I started tossing around a few ideas in my head.  A few days later I found myself in Seattle at Summit 2012. At the PASS Volunteer Party I ran into Luke Jian (<a href="http://blog.sqlpositive.com/">b</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/sensware">t</a>). Luke had recently spoken at SQL Saturday Minnesota and I had first met him at SQL Saturday Madison 2011. Luke asked me point blank &#8220;when are we going to get you speaking!?&#8221;.  I hemmed and hawed, somewhat avoiding the question, and actually answered with a well thought out &#8220;oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. Luke&#8217;s response: &#8220;how about Madison, next year?&#8221;  I wasn&#8217;t sure of it at the time, but a timeline had been set.</p>
<p>Using PASSMN as my &#8220;practice venue&#8221;, I delivered my first UG presentation in March and just delivered the same presentation at my first SQL Saturday, in Madison. Was I nervous, absolutely! Did I let it stop me, absolutely not.  In fact, both presentations went very well.  I am now, without a doubt, in love with presenting.</p>
<p>So what is my advice for someone, like me, just starting out?  Throw yourself, head first, into the SQL Server community. Find a speaker you respect and pick their brain a bit. Odds are they won&#8217;t bite and are willing to provide valuable insight. Feel free to ping me anytime for advice!</p>
<p>Thanks to Bob for hosting this topic.  As I said&#8230;. it is very timely for me!</p>
