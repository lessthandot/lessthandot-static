				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Realizing I was lucky enough to attend PASS Summit 2011, I&#8217;ve decided a blog post is de rigueur.  So, here goes.</p>
<p>Jeremiah Peschka&#8217;s session <i>Rewrite Your T-SQL for Great Good !</i> kept me in stitches.  His statement “We need standards like a Lego whale needs a bicycle” still cracks me up.  I wanna use that line myself, only it probably won&#8217;t be as effective without the photo that Jeremiah used in his slides.  I&#8217;m still scratching my head about his suggestion that code should be tested in Production, though.  I wish he&#8217;d included a methodology for this.  Of course, I may have misunderstood him completely&#8230;</p>
<p>Only Rob Farley&#8217;s session <i>Joins, SARGability and the Evils of Residualiciousness</i> rivaled Jeremiah&#8217;s in terms of entertainment value.  And this had nothing to do with the fact that Rob was wearing a kilt.  Rob is just a funny guy.  I&#8217;m half-disappointed he didn&#8217;t pull out the guitar during his talk, though.  We all could have broken out in song and it would have come as great relief after thinking so many deep thoughts. </p>
<p>Itzik Ben-Gan&#8217;s pre-con <i>Advanced T-SQL for SQL Server 2008 and Denali</i> was a must.  Loved how he typed out his code during his demo so we could see how he thinks.  I figure that&#8217;s the closest thing to getting inside that man&#8217;s brain.  My brain can think like that, too.  I&#8217;m sure of it.  I just need to be patient.  (I&#8217;m still waiting&#8230;)</p>
<p>I was long overdue for Ami Levin&#8217;s talk on physical join operators.  His use of playing cards to demonstrate how the query engine performs joins was brilliant.  I think now I&#8217;ll write better code.</p>
<p>It was a hoot to see Erik Veerman in the flesh at his session <i>Anger Management:  Overcoming SSIS Deployment and Configuration Challenges</i>.  He&#8217;s on the cover of the big, fat SSIS book that&#8217;s been sitting on my desk at work for the past year.  He looks just as good in real life.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the highlights.  All the speakers were good.  But, most importantly, two good things came out of PASS&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started a Lunch &#8216;n Learn where I work so that I can share what I&#8217;ve learned at PASS with my colleagues.  Although I&#8217;m not a big presenter, I&#8217;m excited about the new &#8216;tricks&#8217; I&#8217;ve learned.  I even want to share the esoteric stuff that went over my head, like workspace memory and resource semaphore queues, because if someone else “gets it” it&#8217;s a win-win.  I&#8217;m hoping my enthusiasm for SQL Server is contagious.  Maybe some of the team will even get to go next year.</p>
<p>The second good thing that came out of PASS is that I attended #passprayers for the first time.  Shocking that I got up at 5:00 am to meet for prayers at 6:00.  I&#8217;m not a morning person !  But I did.  And I&#8217;m glad.</p>
<p>Many thanks to @Mike_Walsh for starting this group.  Not a regular church-goer myself, (as I confessed at the gathering, I&#8217;m a bad Catholic!) I nonetheless found myself looking forward to meeting up each morning more and more.  I really can&#8217;t explain how powerful it was to worship together, but I can say that I continue to be inspired by my fellow PASS attendees&#8217; faith.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of things at PASS.  But the most important thing I learned is that PASS stands for <i>PASS</i>ion, &#8211; for the technology we love&#8230;and for the One who makes it all possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You win some, you lose some.  I just took my first Microsoft exam, the 70-448, that covers the BI suite of Analysis Services, Integration Services and Reporting Services for SQL Server 2008.  Wow.  The test was harder than I expected.  Although plenty of time was allotted for taking the exam, some questions included material I hadn’t seen before, even though I read Microsoft’s <em>Self-Paced Training Kit </em>for the exam, cover to cover.  No, I didn’t pass.</p>
<p>Let me back up a bit.  Last summer, I took a week-long course on SSAS 2008 through Global Knowledge and it was great.  Although expensive, devoting a whole week to learning a completely new subject was a real treat.  The instructor mentioned the 70-448 exam and I thought, why not take it ?</p>
<p>To prepare for the exam, I picked up Microsoft’s Training Kit at the instructor’s recommendation.  Although getting through it at times was as torturous as some of the Pilates moves I subject myself to on a Saturday morning, I would recommend it.  Regardless of my test results, the book and practice tests that come with it have helped me better understand many key concepts.  Take the different storage modes for SSAS:  MOLAP, HOLAP, ROLAP.  After my SSAS class, I had a general idea of what these terms meant, but it wasn’t until I came across the following questions on the practice exams that the differences among these modes became clear:  “Which storage method is the best for fast querying ?” (MOLAP), “Which storage method is best if you want to maximize space on the SSAS server, but still want aggregations stored in the cube ?” (HOLAP)</p>
<p>Now, about that material I hadn’t seen before…  One of the questions referenced an MDX statement (I won’t name it so I don’t get in trouble) that was never mentioned in the class I took, nor in the Training Kit.  Okay, okay, this statement <em>is</em> explained in the separate, <em>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 MDX</em> book I bought soon after I took the class (when I was really enthusiastic).  This book came in handy when I needed to create a custom calculation for a report that has a cube for a data source, but have I read the entire book ?  Of course not.  I’m afraid if I get lost in MDX, I’ll never find my way out !</p>
<p>For the Integration Services part of the exam, I didn’t take a class.  Yes, you guessed it, I bought another, big, fat, book – <em>Professional Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Integration Services</em> by Wrox.  I haven’t read the whole thing, just picked out what I’ve needed here and there.  I’ve also learned a lot on the subject from my friend and mentor, Ted Krueger (<a href="/">Blog</a>|<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/onpnt">Twitter</a>) .  I’m definitely not an expert here, but I do know SSIS a whole lot better now than I did a year ago, and I actually like it.</p>
<p>As for the Reporting Services piece, I’ve been creating reports for a few years now, so that section should have been a breeze, right ?  Well, the exam covered a lot of configuration-type tasks that were new to me.  Actually, I’ve gotten Reporting Services to run just fine without knowing many of these features.  I did score best on this section, though.</p>
<p>I will retake the exam – after a whole lot more studying.  Now I know these certifications demonstrate not just knowledge, but mastery of a subject area.  And I’m not quite there, yet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you need an SSRS 2005 report that displays totals for the previous 3 months going horizontally across ?  Well, I did, and my first approach involved using derived tables, each with a separate date range, to get each month’s total to appear in its own column.  While I achieved my goal, performance was lousy because the query needed to execute 3 times (once for each date range).</p>
<p>I shaved 2 minutes off the query execution time with a second approach.  This alternate approach involves using a single query for the entire, 3-month date range, along with a GROUP BY clause including year and month.  For the SSRS piece, I use a matrix format to get the months to display horizontally across.  Since I have additional columns to display besides the total, I have to do some extra maneuvering, but more on that, later.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the T-SQL code:</p>

<p>With the stored procedure written, I’ll go to SSRS 2005 and add a Matrix Report Item.  I then drag the year field to the matrix cell that displays columns, the TerritoryID field (leftmost column on desired report) to the matrix cell that displays rows and the qty field to the matrix data cell (where the columns and rows intersect).</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/ssrs_matrix_1.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>
<p>However, this is not a simple matrix scenario as I have several additional columns I need to display, besides the totals by month.  In order to accomplish this, I’ll add row groups for each additional column.</p>
<p>But first, I’ll start with the column groups.  I right-click above the year column group and choose ‘Add Column Group’ to add the month…</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Add_Column_Group.gif" alt="" title="" width="147" height="98" /></div>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix3.gif" alt="" title="" width="488" height="467" /></div>
<p>…and sort on the month field:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix4.gif" alt="" title="" width="488" height="467" /></div>
<p>That takes care of my column groups.</p>
<p>I proceed in the same fashion for my row groups.  I right-click on the first row group and choose ‘Add Row Group’:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Add_Row_Group.gif" alt="" title="" width="147" height="98" /></div>
<p>I group (and sort) on the next field I want to appear on the report, the ProductNumber:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix6.gif" alt="" title="" width="488" height="467" /></div>
<p>I repeat this until I have all the columns I need.  </p>
<p>As an additional step, for each column and row group I want to sort on, I make sure I’m sorting on the same field I’m grouping on.  To check this, I right-click on the group and choose ‘Edit Group’:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix7.gif" alt="" title="" width="130" height="288" /></div>
<p>Now, the headings for the row group columns are missing because the Matrix Report Item has only an empty box in the upper, lefthand corner by default.  To avoid ambiguity in the report, I add a Rectangle Report Item (to the upper, lefthand corner) then textboxes, one for each column needed:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix8.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>
<p>I then type in the row group column headings:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix9.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="456" /></div>
<p>I also apply some formatting to improve the appearance of the report, including editing the expression for month so that the month name appears:</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/rw_matrix10.gif" alt="" title="" width="628" height="390" /></div>
<p>And voilà !  Below you see the finished report that is speedy and even has column headings for the extra row group columns !</p>
