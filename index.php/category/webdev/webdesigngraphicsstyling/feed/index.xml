				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I built my first website for the NCSA Mosaic browser. A lot has changed since then, and the challenges we had with the original browser wars are upon us again as we try and build sites that work equally well on a variety of mobile phones, tablets, and the desktops that originally gave us so much trouble. Like the browser wars, the two main approaches have been server-side and client-side, with the server-side approach using the browsers User Agent to serve up a browser-specific response and the client-side method being an attempt to serve up one version of HTML that works on all potential browsers.</p>
<p>While the server-side method has not gotten much more advanced, the client-side methods are generations beyond where we used to be. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" alt="Responsive Web Design, A List Apart, Ethan Marcotte">Responsive Web Design</a> and <a href="http://easy-readers.net/books/adaptive-web-design/" alt="Adaptive Web Design, Aaron Gustafson">Adaptive Web Design</a> provide the methods to use CSS and javascript to produce site that scales and progressively enhances to meet the end users device capabilities.</p>
<p>A couple months ago I decided to redesign my personal website again, with the goal of making it provide a good experience at mobile phone, tablet, and monitor sizes. Here&#8217;s how I did it.</p>
<h2>The Screen Sizes</h2>
<p>I decided to focus on screen sizes starting at mobile phone (480px or less) all the way up to large browser (more than 1240px). Each resolution would be usable and contain a similar palette and graphical elements. I also attempted to minimize the amount of extra elements I load at the smaller sizes, assuming that these smaller sizes would have less (and more costly) bandwidth.</p>
<p>These are the layouts I ended up with:</p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/website/SmallPhone.png" alt="Small phone" /></p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/website/LargePhone.png" alt="Large phone" /></p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/website/SmallBrowser.png" alt="Small browser" /></p>
<p><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/website/LargeBrowser.png" alt="Large browser" /></p>
<p>As the available screen real estate gets larger, the logo size increases, the number of social icons increase, and additional inner right sidebar appears, and then finally additional background and an outer right sidebar become available. The width of the available reading area scales smoothly from the smallest size to the largest size.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>While my site doesn&#8217;t have a lot of functionality, achieving the layout changes and addition of features at the largest sizes was still a nice challenge. The key to the site is the CSS media queries that alter the visibility of elements and areas, combined with some javascript to load in larger images or additional elements when relevant. In the event that a browser doesn&#8217;t support media queries and javascript, they will receive the smallest possible layout. Though there are workarounds, I purposefully left the IE8/IE7 layout in this mode, which would also be used for most mobile browsers.</p>
<p>If you load the site in the secondary window and drag the width around, you will be able to see the transitions: <a href="http://tiernok.com/" target="_blank">http://tiernok.com/</a></p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>I cheated a bit on images. Any image with the &#8220;imglow&#8221; CSS class will be hidden above 480 px screen width and replaced with ones that with a class &#8220;imghi&#8221;. Since many small browsers would load the large image even if it is hidden, I put the actual image source in a data attribute and use a bit of javascript to populate the src value.</p>
<p><code class="bwp-syntax-inline"><span style="color: #009900;">&lt;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">br</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">/</span>&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: #009900;">&lt;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">img</span> <span style="color: #000066;">src</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;_n_images/logo_sm.png&quot;</span> <span style="color: #000066;">alt</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Eli Weinstock-Herman | Tarwn&quot;</span> <span style="color: #000066;">border</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;0&quot;</span> <span style="color: #000066;">class</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;imglow&quot;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">/</span>&gt;&lt;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">br</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">/</span>&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: #009900;">&lt;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">img</span> data-fullsrc<span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;_n_images/logo.png&quot;</span> <span style="color: #000066;">alt</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Eli Weinstock-Herman | Tarwn&quot;</span> <span style="color: #000066;">border</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;0&quot;</span> <span style="color: #000066;">class</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;imghi&quot;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">/</span>&gt;&lt;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">br</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">/</span>&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>The social images at the top of the screen have classes that define whether they are available for small resolution or not and display at half resolution in smaller screens. These don&#8217;t load dynamically at larger size, so all 4 will load on browsers that load hidden images.</p>
<p>The background coffee spills start to show at the medium resolutions via positioned background images on the main content wrapper, so these only load when the screen is large enough to display them. This is also when the inner right side panel is displayed, along with the contact image and books. This content is loaded and not displayed at smaller resolutions, so there is some room to shrink that initial mobile load further.</p>
<h3>CSS Media Queries</h3>
<p>The main CSS logic is as follows:</p>
<p><b>&gt; 480 pixels wide:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the small logo, show the large one at reduced size</li>
<li>Increase the size of the 2 social icons in the header</li>
<li>Switch navigation from bar to buttons, show more links</li>
<li>Switch from full screen to fixed borders for main content</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&gt; 650 pixels wide:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Show the large logo at larger size</li>
<li>Show all 4 social icons</li>
<li>Add last two links to navigation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&gt; 750 pixels wide:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Show the large logo at largest size</li>
<li>Show inner right sidebar</li>
<li>Constrain main body to 800px wide</li>
<li>Add coffee stain background images</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&gt; 1000 pixels wide:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Add constraints to content wrapper and area to maintain smooth centering</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&gt; 1240 pixels wide:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Show the outer right sidebar (javascript used to load content asynchronously)</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimizing the pages that were available at the smaller resolutions not only kept the content more focused, but also meant that some of the more complex pages (like the resume) would only be available at resolutions that would support them.</p>
<h2>Am I Happy With It?</h2>
<p>I started the redesign with the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">Html5 boilerplate</a> to give me a consistent start place and minimize how much time I had to deal with browser specific layout tweaks. I did tweak the media query resolutions quite a bit as I built out the pages, but part of this was my lack of designer skills and not having a clear enough picture of what I wanted the site to look like. </p>
<p>Currently a mobile device without javascript will load about 83KB of content (obviously this changes based on what is on the front-page of the site). With Javascript this goes up to 160KB for mobile and 800&#215;600 resolutions and 200KB for the largest screen size. I think the smaller resolutions could be reduced further by restricting the inner sidebar content and small icon loading, and the whole site could do with some minification and gzip. </p>
<p>Overall I am very happy with it. The size is usable at every resolution I try and this method doesn&#8217;t rely on the client-side user agent. Additional functionality would be easy to add, as I could use feature detection to add functionality only if the end user&#8217;s browser supported it, regardless of the user agent string. I&#8217;m very happy with the result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to take a look at my <a href="/index.php/WebDev/WebDesignGraphicsStyling/has-firefox-lost-its-mojo-are-firefox-us">Has FireFox lost its Mojo, are Firefox user jumping ship to Chrome?</a> post to compare the browser stats. In that post I wrote the following </p>
<blockquote><p>So what will happen to Firefox will they ever pass 25% or is this a downward spiral and within a year Chrome will have that 25% and Firefox will be at 15% or so? With all the new stuff like the Google&#8217;s App Store that Google is adding to Chrome its usage will have to grow fast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well Firefox never reached 25%, as a matter of fact Firefox  is at less than 20% market share today. Here is what the stats look like for the last 12 months according to <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1">NetMarket Share</a></p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/BrowserStats.PNG?mtime=1328978705"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/BrowserStats.PNG?mtime=1328978705" width="805" height="235" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see Chrome has almost surpassed Firefox, I think that in 2 or 3 months Google will have surpassed Firefox. A lot of people still use Firefox because of the fact that some extensions don&#8217;t exist on Chrome. NoScript is a big one, Chrome has actually somethign similar, it is called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiigbmnaadbkfbmpbfijlflahbdbdgdf">ScriptNo</a>. FireBug is another reason that people stick with FireFox for now. Even Germany&#8217;s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/5/2771834/german-agency-google-chrome-safety">recommending Chrome</a> now, they did not pick FireFox.</p>
<p>A lot of people are ranting about the fact that Firefox has become bloated, yes compared to Internet Explorer it might look lean but compared to Chrome it certainly does not. We have to wait and see what happens, I will revisit this again early next year. </p>
<p>I also wonder if the release of Windows 8 will do anything to make Internet Explorer gain some market share again?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the way back in 2010 Google realized that JavaScript is a dead end programming language.</p>
<p>Here is what was posted on the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/uro3jtoitlmq6x7t">com.googlegroups.google-caja-discuss</a> list</p>
<blockquote><p>Javascript has fundamental flaws that cannot be fixed merely by evolving the<br />
language.  We&#8217;ll adopt a two-pronged strategy for the future of Javascript:</p>
<p>   &#8211; Harmony (low risk/low reward): continue working in conjunction with<br />
   TC39 (the EcmaScript standards body) to evolve Javascript<br />
   &#8211; Dash (high risk/high reward): Develop a new language (called Dash) that<br />
   aims to maintain the dynamic nature of Javascript but have a better<br />
   performance profile and be amenable to tooling for large projects. Push for<br />
   Dash to become an open standard and be adopted by other browsers. Developers<br />
   using Dash tooling will be able to use a cross-compiler to target Javascript<br />
   for browsers that do not support Dash natively.</p></blockquote>
<p>A new language will be announced at the goto conference named Dart, the keynote will be:  <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/presentation/Opening%20Keynote:%20Dart,%20a%20new%20programming%20language%20for%20structured%20web%20programming">Opening Keynote: Dart, a new programming language for structured web programming</a></p>
<p>Assuming that Dash is now called Dart, here is what it is supposed to do, again according to the posting on the com.googlegroups.google-caja-discuss list</p>
<blockquote><p>Dash is the leapfrog effort that is designed to be a clean break from<br />
Javascript.  It will seek to keep the parts that have made the Internet so<br />
successful, but fill in holes everyone agrees it has.</p>
<p>Dash is designed with three perspectives in mind:</p>
<p>   &#8211; Performance &#8212; Dash is designed with performance characteristics in<br />
   mind, so that it is possible to create VMs that do not have the performance<br />
   problems that all EcmaScript VMs must have.<br />
   &#8211; Developer Usability &#8212; Dash is designed to keep the dynamic,<br />
   easy-to-get-started, no-compile nature of Javascript that has made the web<br />
   platform the clear winner for hobbyist developers.<br />
   &#8211; Ability to be Tooled &#8212; Dash is designed to be more easily tooled (e.g.<br />
   with optional types) for large-scale projects that require<br />
   code-comprehension features such as refactoring and finding callsites.<br />
    Dash, however, does not require tooling to be effective&#8211;small-scale<br />
   developers may still be satisfied with a text editor.</p>
<p>Dash is also designed to be securable, where that ability does not seriously<br />
conflict with the three main goals.</p>
<p>Dash will be designed to be consumed in a number of locations:</p>
<p>   &#8211; Browser VM &#8212; Our aspiration is that Dash will ultimately be a viable<br />
   substitute for Javascript as the native client-side language of choice<br />
   across all browsers.<br />
   &#8211; Front-end Server &#8212; Dash will be designed as a language that can be<br />
   used server-side for things up to the size of Google-scale Front Ends.  This<br />
   will allow large scale applications to unify on a single language for client<br />
   and front end code.<br />
   &#8211; Dash Cross Compiler &#8212; Dash will be designed so that a large subset of<br />
   it can be compiled to target legacy Javascript platforms so teams that<br />
   commit to using Dash do not have to seriously limit their reach.  Platforms<br />
   that have a Dash VM can operate on the original Dash code without<br />
   translation and take advantage of the increased performance.  One of the<br />
   ways we will evolve Harmony is to be a better target for such compiled Dash<br />
   code.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far we don&#8217;t know much about this new language except for what they say about Dash, we can assume that it will address some of the points that were posted in the list which I shared in this post earlier</p>
<p>Even if this new language is better than JavaScript will all the other browser vendors be on board? Remember that Google launched the <a href="http://golang.org/">Go language</a> last year, what happened to that?</p>
<p>I am skeptical about all of this but of course I could be dead wrong</p>
<p>Time will tell&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bing, Google and Yahoo! have announced <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a></p>
<p>Here is the info</p>
<p>Today we’re announcing schema.org, a new initiative from Yahoo!, Bing, and Google, to create and support a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages. With schema.org, webmasters and developers can learn about structured data and improve how their sites appear in search results on Bing, Google, and Yahoo!. Information and tips are available on schema.org, a one-stop resource for webmasters looking to add markup to make their pages better understood by search engines.</p>
<h2>What is Schema.org?</h2>
<p>This site provides a collection of schemas, i.e., html tags, that webmasters can use to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers. Search engines including Bing, Google and Yahoo! rely on this markup to improve the display of search results, making it easier for people to find the right web pages.<br />
Many sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to recover the original structured data. Many applications, especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data. On-page markup enables search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web. Markup can also enable new tools and applications that make use of the structure.<br />
A shared markup vocabulary makes easier for webmasters to decide on a markup schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. So, in the spirit of sitemaps.org, Bing, Google and Yahoo! have come together to provide a shared collection of schemas that webmasters can use.</p>

<p><iframe style="height: 288px; width: 512px; " src="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/First-Look-Internet-Exploer-10-Platform-Preview/player?w=512&amp;h=288" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Here is what they say on the channel 9 site</p>
<blockquote><p>Just when you were expecting to hear more about IE9 on this opening day of Mix &#8217;11, and today we&#8217;ll be talking about the IE10 Platform Preview. IE10 builds on IE9 with support for even more standards like CSS3 gradients, multi-column, and grid layouts. In this video Rob Mauceri walks us through some of the new features of IE10 including an example of flowing of content in multi-column layouts.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here is Dean Hachamovitch, corporate vice president in charge of the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft wearing a shirt with the IE 10 logo during the IE keynote ate Mix 11 today.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/5613176833/" title="IE10 preview released"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5143/5613176833_d7febf783d.jpg" width="337" height="307" alt="IE10 preview released" /></a></p>
<p>Developers can download the Internet Explorer 10 Platform Preview at http://www.IETestDrive.com/ and provide direct feedback through new code refreshes approximately every 12 weeks.</p>
<p>I wonder if they are going to do a more aggressive release schedule like the Chrome browser. Anything is better than the waiting period between IE6 and IE7, that was insane.</p>
<p>Make sure to check it out here: http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/First-Look-Internet-Exploer-10-Platform-Preview</p>
<p>Also make sure to check out Mix 11 here http://live.visitmix.com/ for the keynotes over the next 3 days</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is about stats from hits to this website. I always find this interesting because you can get a feel of what is moving and shaking in the tech industry. Of course the stats on this site are heavily skewed towards technology and although this site is small compared to something like reddit or del.icio.us we still get millions of hits a year so it is not a sample of 10 hits  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Smart phones</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/SmartPhones.png" alt="" title="" width="559" height="285" /><br />
As you can see from that chart, in January iPhone was at 70% and it ended up in December at 34%, Android went from 13% to 40%, Android activations are almost double now compared to Apple&#8217;s in the last quarter. My predictions is that Android will have at least 55% share by the end of next year. It is not all doom and gloom for Apple however, the iPad managed to rise to almost 19% since April. Below are the numbers that were used to generate the chart.</p>

<h2>Browsers</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/Browsers.png" alt="" title="" width="598" height="279" /><br />
The year 2010 was a very good year for Chrome, Chrome has more than doubled its share, FireFox lost about 8% and IE lost about 5%. Now that Chrome has a lot of the Extensions that FireFox has I think even more people will switch to Chrome, I have been using Chrome since the first beta version and have never gone back to fireFox or IE. My predictions is that Chrome will capture a third of the market by the end of next year.</p>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/IE.png" alt="" title="" width="592" height="297" /><br />
Internet Explorer 6 is slowly going to below 5% share, IE8 is the most used browser with almost 70% share. I tried IE 9 a couple of times, I like the speed and the other improvements it has but it won&#8217;t be enough to make me switch from Chrome</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stop me if you&#8217;ve heard this one&#8230;a programmer walks up to a DBA and says, &#8220;The database is slow.&#8221; </p>
<p>One of the many performance tuning and troubleshooting tools in the SQL Server DBA toolbelt is Profiler. You pick events you want to see, set up a trace, and watch the events roll by. The problem is that this graphical tool, especially when run from a workstation, can place a heavy load on the server. </p>
<p>A better way to perform a trace of events is to run it on the server. I was asked to do this at work last week, and had to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to do that.&#8221; I learned something new, and I want to share it with you! </p>
<p><b>Setting Up the Trace </b></p>
<p>First, set up the trace using SQL Server Profiler, preferably against a development or test database. (The GUI tool can negatively affect performance, so be careful on production databases.) To do this, in SSMS go to Tools > SQL Server Profiler. Add a trace name, choose to save to a file, and enable file rollover. This last option means that when the max file size is reached, a new file will be created. </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/ProfilerPropertiesGeneral.JPG" alt="" title="" width="886" height="641" /></div>
<p>Next, go to Events Selection and check your events. I’ve chosen a standard template for this test. </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/ProfilerPropertiesEvents.JPG" alt="" title="" width="888" height="641" /></div>
<p>Click “Run” to begin the trace. I executed a stored procedure in my AdventureWorks database to make sure the trace was capturing data. </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/ProfilerRunning.JPG" alt="" title="" width="692" height="565" /></div>
<p><b>Making a Server-Side Trace</b> </p>
<p>Now, I stop the trace and create the script for a server-side trace. In Profiler, go to File > Export > Script Trace Definition > For SQL Server 2005 – 2008 R2. You will be prompted to save the .sql file, and notified when it is saved. </p>
<p>Now, open the .sql file in SQL Server Management Studio. It will look similar to this: </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/ProfilerTraceSQL.JPG" alt="" title="" width="786" height="520" /></div>
<p>On line 19, you will need to specify where to save the output files. This might be a location on the server, or a share drive on your network. </p>
<p>Once those settings have been chosen, verify that you are connected to the correct server and Execute. Ta-da! You’ve just started a server-side trace. </p>
<p><b>Stopping the Server-Side Trace </b></p>
<p>Eventually, you will probably want to stop this trace. Collecting an infinite amount of data may sound fun, but there won&#8217;t be any value in it. </p>
<p>First, you’ll need the trace ID. </p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1

<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SELECT * FROM :: fn_trace_getinfo(default)</pre></div></div>

<p>Your results might look something like this: </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/grrlgeek/fn_trace_getinforesults.JPG" alt="" title="" width="428" height="236" /></div>
<p>Traceid is the ID on the server. I currently have two, 1 and 2. Property is the ID of the trace property.<br />
•	1 – Trace Options<br />
•	2 – File Name<br />
•	3 – Max size<br />
•	4 – Stop time (if set)<br />
•	5 – Current trace status. </p>
<p>The status options are:<br />
•	0 – Stopped<br />
•	1 – Running </p>
<p>I determine that the trace I just started has the ID of 2. To stop the trace, I use sp_trace_setstatus. The syntax is </p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw3">sp_trace_setstatus</span> traceid, statusid</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">sp_trace_setstatus traceid, statusid</pre></div></div>

<p>The status options are:<br />
•	0 – Stop<br />
•	1 – Start<br />
•	2 – Close and delete definition from server </p>
<p>So, to stop traceid 2, I run this command: </p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw3">sp_trace_setstatus</span> <span class="nu0">2</span>, <span class="nu0">0</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">sp_trace_setstatus 2, 0</pre></div></div>

<p>I can verify it has been stopped by re-running </p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">SELECT</span> <span class="sy0">*</span> <span class="kw1">FROM</span> :: <span class="kw4">fn_trace_getinfo</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="kw1">default</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> </pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SELECT * FROM :: fn_trace_getinfo(default) </pre></div></div>

<p>I can then open the .trc file in SQL Server Profiler and examine it for performance issues. </p>
<p>I was pretty excited to learn this. I hope this can help you out too!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately we&#8217;ve been playing around with RIA services for Silverlight. Using them we lose the use of our stack, but the speed of development with them is quite impressive. </p>
<h2>Watch and Learn</h2>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with RIA in Silverlight, I would recommend this video: <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/videos/all/net-ria-services-intro/">http://www.silverlight.net/learn/videos/all/net-ria-services-intro/</a>. It is a complete walk through of creating a demo from the &#8216;Business Application&#8217; template in Visual Studio for SL 3. If you are working in SL4, be sure to check the comments in the video for the breaking changes.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Skinny?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty fancy stuff. You make an Entity Framework model, based on your database. Then when you compile, the template generates a whole bunch of code for you. First, on the server it generates a Service and a Metadata class to expose your data entities and basic CRUD functionality to the client. Then in the client, another class is generated that handles the serialization and exposing of those server classes client side. One of the most impressive things about this interaction though, is that the return objects from the server are IQueriable, not arrays. Which gives you the ability to perform LINQ and deferred execution from the client!</p>
<h2>So Why the Fuss?</h2>
<p>Watch the video, play around with it. I&#8217;m not going to go through the whole thing here, but I will show you something I ran into.</p>
<p>I have a relational database, in this case I am looking at the <em>League</em> and <em>Player</em> tables. <em>League</em> has an OwnerPlayer_ID field that links to the <em>Player</em> table. The problem though, by using the RIA services and bindings out of the box, is that while the League class has a .Player property, it will never be populated. And showing people that a League is owned by Player #5237 isn&#8217;t nearly as helpful as showing them the Player&#8217;s name. We have to make 2 changes to get this to work correctly.</p>
<h2>Reprimanding that Lazy EF</h2>
<p>On the server side, find your service class. It should be called something like &#8216;MyApplicationDomainService1&#8217; and be in the &#8216;Services&#8217; folder by default. In that class look for a method called &#8216;GetMyObjects&#8217; where MyObjects is the collection you are binding to on the client side. It should contain something like &#8216;Return (Me.ObjectContext.MyObjects)&#8217;. Change it to:<br />
<code =VB>Return (Me.ObjectContext.MyObjects.Include("MyChildObject")</code><br />
In my case this was the &#8216;GetLeagues&#8217; method and it contains: &#8216;Return (Me.ObjectContext.Leagues.Include(&#8220;Player&#8221;))&#8217;</p>
<p>This will tell the Entity Framework model that it should Eager Load the .Player property. But before we rejoice and rebuild, wait, there&#8217;s more!</p>
<h2>Getting RIA up off the Couch</h2>
<p>Next up, right next to the DomainService1 file should be a file called MyApplicationDomainService1.metadata. In this file we need to find the class that represents what we are querying (The &#8220;MyObject&#8221; from the previous step). In that class you should see the property you want to load (The &#8220;MyChildObject&#8221; from above). On this property, you want to prepend the &lt;Include()&gt; attribute. This will tell the RIA services that it should include this property in the serialization and transmission of the query results. </p>
<p>In my case of League and Owner Player, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>    Friend NotInheritable Class LeagueMetadata
             
        '...

        &lt;Include()&gt;
        &lt;Display(AutoGenerateField:=False)&gt;
        Public Property Player As Player
        '...
    End Class</pre>
<h2>And the Grid?</h2>
<p>Now that the EF is loading the data we want, and the RIA services are returning the data we want, all we have to do is bind it! And this is the easiest part. It is just like they show in the video, with one minor change. Instead of just binding on the primary object&#8217;s property, we use dot notation to get at the child object&#8217;s property. Shown here as the &#8220;Player.Name&#8221; binding</p>
<pre>&lt;sdk:DataGrid x:Name="grdLeagues" Margin="4,20,4,4" Grid.Row="1" ItemsSource="{Binding ElementName=LeagueDomainDataSource, Path=Data}" AutoGenerateColumns="False"&gt;
    &lt;sdk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Name}" Header="Name" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Player.Name, Mode=OneWay}" Header="Organizer" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Province}" Header="State" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=City}" Header="City" /&gt;
        &lt;sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=LGS}" Header="Game Store" /&gt;
    &lt;/sdk:DataGrid.Columns&gt;
&lt;/sdk:DataGrid&gt;</pre>
<p>-Rick</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent <a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1580016.aspx?PageIndex=1">thread</a> in ASP.NET forums is the primary reason for this blog post.</p>
<p>I want to show how error messages from the SQL Server were handled in our web pages. The site I was working on had most of the functionality developed by the previous developer. Unfortunately, most pages didn&#8217;t use a separation of layers and used SQLDataSource for data manipulations.</p>
<p>The sample I want to show was called from InsertPerson.aspx page. For inserting a person we used the stored procedure I showed in my previous blog <a href="/index.php/WebDev/?p=553">How to insert information into multiple related tables and return ID using SQLDataSource</a>.</p>
<p>For inserting a new person the InsertPerson.aspx page was used that had multiview control, FormView controls with different tabs using User Controls for each tab (the tab was a special control designed by my colleague).</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the page&#8217;s code:</p>
<pre>&lt;asp:Label ID="UPDATE_OPENER" runat="server" Visible="false" Text=""&gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;
    
    &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;

<p>So, hopefully you see the logic of the pages. The CreatePerson page had a place to show an error message or a link if the insert worked correctly. From the InsertPerson page we manipulated the parent CreatePerson page and displayed the appropriate message (either the error message or a link to edit a newly inserted person).</p>
