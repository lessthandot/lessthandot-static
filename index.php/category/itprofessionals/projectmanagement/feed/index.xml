		<description><![CDATA[A business person is asking an IT person to implement a blog using XYZ NoSQL database and the IT person pushes back, but by the way here's this business opportunity I thought of.

Why is it wrong for a business person to ask for an IT solution, but OK for an IT person to suggest a business solution?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monday I caught the <a href="http://foodfightshow.org/">Food Fight Show</a>, discussing <a href="http://foodfightshow.org/2013/03/the-phoenix-project.html">The Phoenix Project</a> and featuring Gene Kim (<a href="http://www.realgenekim.me/" title="Gene Kim's website">site</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim" title="@realgenekim on twitter">twitter</a>), Jez Humble (<a href="http://jezhumble.net/" title="Jez's website">blog</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble" title="@jezhumble on twitter">twitter</a>), and Matthew Zeier (<a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mrz/" title="mrz's Mozilla/Firefox blog">blog</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/mrz" title="@mrz on twitter">twitter</a>). </p>
<p>Part of the way through the show, a conversation took place that I couldn&#8217;t get out of my head. </p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s the situation:</h2>
<p>A business person is asking IT to implement a blog using a specific NoSQL database solution and we push back and try to examine why they want it, and oh by the way we have this great business opportunity for you (around 29:30). </p>
<p>Which reminded me of a related question I heard (I thought in the show, but apparently it must have been earlier in the day):</p>
<blockquote><p>Why it is OK for the IT person to talk business to the business person, when it&#8217;s not OK for the business person to talk IT to the IT person.</p></blockquote>
<p>What bothered me the whole drive home is the built in assumption that the business and IT are separate entities. The panel went deep into value streams and hypotheses-driven development from here, but I think there was something wrong with the root of this story, where we accepted the separation of IT person and business. This may seem overly detail-oriented, but I think far too many IT people see themselves exactly this way. </p>
<h2>And it&#8217;s wrong.</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the flaw in this story (and every other place we talk about IT vs the business):</p>
<p>Joe Random Executive doesn&#8217;t know all the intricacies of accounting, purchasing, warehousing, marketing, sales, law, human resources, or any of a dozen other areas. They will probably know a couple in detail, but they are no more an expert in the rest then they are in IT (and of course we assume they didn&#8217;t have an IT Background). These are all skills or roles that get casually lumped under the &#8220;business&#8221; umbrella. Because somehow all areas but IT are business, while only IT is non-business.</p>
<p>Is this ego or laziness? Some of both. Only in the IT department do we somehow think our role gives us a magic ticket to be totally ignorant about the company we work for. </p>
<h2>This is absurd.</h2>
<p>It makes no more sense then suggesting that accounting is far too intricate to spend time learning how the business around them works. Or that the ever-changing logistics and supply market supersedes understanding the products we are purchasing or shipping. Or that knowing what markets we sell to has any importance to the lawyers. Or that our business growth strategies should take any time away from HR activities around screening and hiring,.</p>
<p>Maybe the whole company is siloed, but seeing it as IT vs The Business is silly (see Gene Kim&#8217;s point 25 minutes in).</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">As an aside, spellcheck prefers to call that soiled. I find myself in agreement.</div>
<p>But wait, these are IT ops people talking, surely this is different, right? </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you a hint, Gene Kim talks early on about how The Phoenix Project was influenced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_%28novel%29">The Goal (Eliyahu Goldratt)</a>, whose main character is a plant operations manager. So no, IT Ops, IT QA, IT Technician, you are no more off the hook then the enormous variety of lawyers a business may need to work with over the course of it&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>There are two types of workers, and they aren&#8217;t IT and non-IT, they are engaged and not engaged. </p>
<h2>Are you doing your job?</h2>
<p>Are you doing the job, or just playing with technology?</p>
<p>An engaged worker knows how the company works, at some level. They can discuss the strategies the business is executing, what their company does, and who their customers are. They may not be able to discuss these things with equal facility as the executives or experts in specific departments, but they can have an intelligent conversation about their business. </p>
<p>The not-engaged worker is just there to do a job and go home. They are the protectors of turf, the ones that deny every request they can get away with, or the ones that simply don&#8217;t care. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Ignorance of how your company works is a sign of incompetence, not something to be proud of. </div>
<p>So the reason an IT person (even an IT Ops person) can speak to a non-IT worker about the business is because &#8220;the business&#8221; is the common language they share. IT, accounting, purchasing, human resources, whoever &#8230; when we need to discuss why something is important, we discuss it&#8217;s impact on the the business, the strategies or targets it effects, etc. In fact, being in IT typically requires a <u>higher</u> level of day-to-day, cross-functional contact then any of the prior examples. More, not less.</p>
<p>Engaging the business has come and gone as part of many buzzy things, and in DevOps it&#8217;s rising again. Regardless of it&#8217;s current popularity, if you work for a company, being an IT person doesn&#8217;t magically separate you from the goals everyone else is working towards. Engage, learn the business, help them succeed, you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;re company is doing some really interesting things and works with some really interesting people. If it&#8217;s not, find one that resonates with you and learn what they&#8217;re doing. Either way, you&#8217;re part of the business, an you chose whether you&#8217;re competent or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a Droid phone user for some time now and really, couldn’t have imagined using anything else.  One of the things that is always important to me is, efficiency in work.  That being said, Droid has always been quick to find what I need, actually makes calls and has the tools I need to get the job done.  So why would I even consider going to a Windows 8 Phone?  Well, “Look, Shiny!!!!”  No, really, that wasn’t it.  </p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/winphone_1.gif?mtime=1359380136"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/winphone_1.gif?mtime=1359380136" width="402" height="190" /></a></div>
</p>
<p><strong>Total Package</strong></p>
<p>I went out and purchased the HTC Windows 8X Phone a few days ago.  The reason this diehard Droid guy went to Windows 8 Phone was the complete integration across devices and information.  That’s a mouthful so let me explain by showing you the devices I have, helping me get my job done, daily.  </p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-26.png?mtime=1359380136"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-26.png?mtime=1359380136" width="107" height="72" align="left" /></a></div>
<p>Currently I am running Windows 8 Pro on a ThinkPad W530.  Since this W530 was right out of the box recently, I chose to not mess with the preinstalled Windows 7 image and stripped it of its glory right away and went to Windows 8 Pro.  Why?  Windows 8 Pro I believe has the efficiency pieces that help me eliminate many 1-second delays in the day.  I haven’t been let down at all with Windows 8 Pro either and can’t imagine going back to Windows 7. In fact, I adapted so quickly to Windows 8 Pro and the tile, navigation and utilization changes, I’d say that is the single largest win of the new OS.  However, this isn’t a Windows 8 Pro review (maybe later).  </p>
<p>Throwing into the mix of my work machine, I have a machine I use for presenting and working on articles/demos.  That machine was quickly upgraded to Windows 8 as well.  Both machines are using VMWare Workstation so I can’t really lose here.  I need Windows 7 or Windows Server 2012 or 2003 to test something, bam, done and pushing forward.  </p>
<p>Here comes the phone – thrown into all of this, I have a Droid RAZR.  Awesome phone!  This Motorola phone feels great in your hand, , quick to get what I need done, has excellent battery life and I have no real complaints.  Why would I change that?  Well, Windows 8 in short.  Recall, I’m into hardcore efficiency in each day of how I get the job done.  Whether you want to argue there are ways to do all kinds of things or not, the fact is, Droid and Windows 8 are not the same thing.  I had some pains from that and what I would have to do in order to get everything working nice together.  Even the corporate sync for mail and opening an Excel or Word attachment on the Droid was painful at times.  </p>
<p>Microsoft, in my eyes, is doing one thing that I’d wish the entire industry would do: seamless integration with all devices.  Now, this would be like asking for world peace to get the big dogs all making the same thing with a slight twist for marketing.  They won’t do it.  They never have.  That’s why third party applications and interfaces are in business.  So my reasoning for what would obviously be a few days of pain by switching my phone OS was, seamless integration between all of the technology I put my hands on for work and personal use.  </p>
<p>With Windows 8 across the landscape of my devices, it makes me more efficient.  I could care less if you have issues with Windows and love your Droid or iPhone, bottom line is, you have to admit, having one OS across it all lends itself to efficiency. Now, if that OS was crashing every 5 minutes or plain old, sucks,  that isn’t efficient.  However, Windows 8 has proven to fit right into my work and personal usage without such ease, I could not avoid the fact, it made sense to make it so across the board.</p>
<p>Review – 2 day</p>
<p>It’s been two days now since I picked up the HTC Windows 8X (Verizon).  So far, there has been some pain.  Duh, I just changed the OS on my phone!  If you know me, you know my phone is attached to me so changing it will be painful at first.  Luckily, Windows 8 is pretty much Windows 8 from Laptop to Phone to Tablet.  See where my reasoning was? </p>
<p>With all of that, there is a few things I have found irritating, now being the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of having the phone.</p>
<ol>
<li>Seriously, Microsoft has Bing Maps but we don’t get a voice navigation like google Maps?  Yeah, in order to get navigation I need to use the costly VZ Navigator or buy an app.  Now, an app that is $4.99 may be worth it. I just nee to read the reviews.  I’m still a bit irritated it doesn’t have a default GPS navigation option built in.</li>
<li>Some apps do not rotate.  Windows 8 Phone is young still and I foresaw this issue.  A lot of application simple are being updated almost every other day.  Facebook for example, will not rotate the screen when I rotate the phone.  That’s annoying for someone with big hands and can’t stand typing on a phone in horizontal view.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it!  Really, that is it.  Other than navigation, I have been able to find every app I need to get right back to where I was with Droid.  </p>
<p>So, what’s good about it?  It’s too early to give a down and dirty, pro vs. con, review.  I will do that as it is always helpful in making decisions on moving to a new device and OS.  The one thing I will leave you with is activity.  </p>
<p><strong>Activity Quick Glance</strong></p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-27.png?mtime=1359380136"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-27.png?mtime=1359380136" width="154" height="96" align="left" /></a></div>
<p>That is what I’ve deemed the best thing about Windows 8 Phone.  The one thing I don’t think I’d want to give up in just two days of using the HTC Windows 8X phone is, I can see everything in one tile for activity across email, text, twitter and on.  I open the tile, look at all the things that happened since last looking at it, and I’m up to date without opening 5 or 6 apps.  That is really cool!  Now, Droid may have been able to do that, in fact, I think I remember finding it once but it was horribly done.  I can’t go into details about Droid and that option because, well, I *think* I found that once.  Windows 8 just gave it to me.  I like just being handed what is useful.  The other nice thing about the activity on the phone is, if I open the view and I don’t read something, it doesn’t persist to keep telling me I have new activity.  I like that a lot too.  My Droid would constantly think I had new emails even knowing I would open email and just read the subject lines.  </p>
<p><strong>That’s it!</strong></p>
<p>That’s about all I have for the start of my 3rd day with the HTC Windows 8X phone.  I can say, if you are up on Windows 8 for your tablet device and laptop, it really does make sense to be there on your phone.  Hopefully this and the upcoming reviews or the phone will help make that choice for you as well. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many projects have you worked on that were run by a dedicated project manager (PM)? How many were run by a business analyst (BA)? Was there a notable difference in how they were planned, scheduled and executed? For that matter, does it make a difference whether a project is run by a business analyst or a dedicated project manager?</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/511_3632971.jpg?mtime=1358642746"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/511_3632971.jpg?mtime=1358642746" width="640" height="480" /></a></div>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">When I was a developer, I worked on projects in both scenarios. Now that I work as a project manager (and occasionally as a business analyst depending upon the project), I find that the differences between them are more clearly delineated if still fairly nuanced. There are managers who see little or no difference between the role of a project manager and a business analyst. And there are those who see defined value in separating the two. In my experience, the breakdown tends to occur based on the size and scope of a given project. The larger and more complex a project, the more likely you will find a project manager implementing it.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">What is the difference between the two roles?</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">First, a BA is typically expected to possess significant business knowledge with the ability to translate that knowledge into requirements from user requests to update or enhance systems (or even to create new systems, sometimes). They are also expected to have excellent communication skills in order to not only understand what the user is asking for, but to also know what they need but are not asking for. Then, they translate that into technical requirements that enable a developer to start their work without having to go back and forth all the time. In short, <a href="http://www.iiba.org/IIBA/Professional_Development/What_is_Business_Analysis/IIBA_Website/Professional_Development/What_is_Business_Analysis/What_is_Business_Analysis.aspx" target="_blank">they are the agent for change to their organization</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">A PM is expected to be able to manage and deliver the project from beginning to end. They are expected to understand what is needed from the big picture perspective while still being able to drive the smaller details through to completion. They coordinate all of the pieces into a single cohesive framework that they then execute to completion with the various stakeholders. They must be able to communicate at all levels to ensure that everyone on the project has the information they need to complete their tasks within a given timeframe and budget as well as the flexibility to handle the inevitable challenges that arise within every project. They are the ones to whom the project’s success or failure is dependent. In short, <a href="http://www.pmi.org/About-Us/About-Us-Who-are-Project-Managers.aspx" target="_blank">they deliver specific process changes to their organization</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">And the difference between the two roles is defined thusly – the agent who is responsible for understanding and translating what needs to be done at the lower levels versus a true “manager” – for lack of a better term – who is able to see the big picture, put all of the pieces together, and ensure that any issues are handled as they arise with limited disruption to the project as a whole. While smaller projects often can be run by a business analyst or project manager because the scope will be fairly limited by definition, larger projects will often necessitate a true project manager who can truly manage the greater array of aspects that are part of said project.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Day and I am finishing the last of my traditional holiday vacation. Tomorrow, I will return to my office after a hiatus of almost two weeks and am sure I will spend most of the day inundated by emails and following up on the projects that were in process when I left. But today, I was reading through recent blog posts by two of our more prolific writers here on LessThanDot, Onpnt (Ted Krueger) with <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/consulting/blogging-isn-t-easy-unless">Blogging isn&#8217;t easy unless you have support</a> and SQLDenis (Denis Gobo) with <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/ProfessionalDevelopment/ah-yes-those-pesky-resolutions">Ah yes, those pesky resolutions</a>. I have to admit, both of them have inspired me with my own resolutions and blogging.</p>
<p>I went back and looked at my own blog posts over the time since we first began LessThanDot. In total, I have 11 that I have written, 4 of them written in 2012 (which is more than I originally thought I had done). I have at least one that is currently in process from this past August after a conversation with fellow LTD&#8217;er Chrissie1 but not sure if I remember enough of what I originally intended to write that I will be able to finish it. That being said, though, I love to write and, quite frankly, am rather disappointed with the efforts I have put forth in writing more on this site. My own personal blog is not much better. But, I am setting forth a goal to write 12 new blogposts this year on LessThanDot &#8211; which would be 3 times my best year to this point. I do not think an average of one a month is unreasonable and it will hopefully prod me to produce better work than I have done to this point.</p>
<p>As Ted noted in his own post yesterday, the more we write, the better we become and, while I do consider myself to be fairly proficient when it comes to writing, I have also found that my skills have deteriorated from lack of use. Additionally, I know what I want to say but being able to do so succinctly, directly and ensuring that the reader interprets what I wrote as I intended for them to do so can be challenging and I hope to improve this. As a project manager, this is a very important skill as one of the major bugaboos of any project is miscommunication and misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Finally, while I do not typically set a great deal of resolutions, I will do so this year. In addition to more blog posts, I intend to do at least two formal training classes offered by my company to further my skills in project management. Frankly, there is still a great deal that I have not yet learned and I would like to be better so that I can handle whatever comes my way professionally.</p>
<p>So a Happy New Year to everyone!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Project management, unlike development in some ways, is not so much a skill as it is an art. Each project must be managed differently because of the various personalities, skills and requirements needed to complete it. This should seem obvious but, to many project managers, it is not. I learned this as a result of a project that I participated in recently &#8211; but not as the project manager in this case.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll add a caveat here &#8211; this is the second version of this particular post. I do not normally go through several revisions of my blog posts but it was necessary here as my first version was more an indictment of the project I was on rather than an impartial view of the failures that occurred and thoughts on how to make it better. Complaining about things may make people feel better in the short run but it does not help to provide long-term solutions to ensure the problems do not occur on the next project. One additional caveat is to point out that the experiences listed here on a fairly small project, only a half-dozen personnel and a timeframe of a few months (within a large organization, trust me, that is a fairly quick turnaround).</p>
<p>Perhaps the one key to any successful project is to have only a single project manager. This may seem a fairly obvious point but it is something that was hammered home on the aforementioned project. Indeed, after further reflection, this has not been uncommon in my experience though typically multiple project managers each handle various aspects of a given project, so it would be more like sub-project managers to a larger overall project. But the underlying point is that there should only ever be a single project manager at the top-most level and the delineation between that manager and any others should be very clear from the outset.</p>
<p>The next key is constant and open communication bewteen the project manager and all members of the project team. I will admit that this is a major issue for me and I work very hard to ensure that everyone has not just the information they need to do their piece of a project but also a view of the bigger picture. This serves two goals: they know exactly what they need to do but also gives them a piece of ownership of the larger project as a whole. It also helps to foster greater teamwork and accountability. When (not if, because the reality is that it will always happen) there is a problem within the project, if the team is already communicating, those problems can be addressed more quickly with fewer cascading issues as a result. For example, a problem on the part of one member of the team can be addressed by another if brought out into the open or a delay by one member can be addressed so that it does not cascade to the rest of the project. For projects with tight deadlines, a failure to communicate can prove disastrous.</p>
<p>Finally, there should only ever be a single source for the data needed for the project. Again, this should be fairly obvious but it is amazing how often failures can be traced back to this issue. There should only ever be one master project plan that the team uses to manage progress. And, if the project is a data-driven project, then all of the data should be in a single repository and not necessarily managed across a variety of applications or segmented by team/member. It does not matter if the plan is done in Project, Excel or some other project management software so long as everyone is operating off of the same plan. Correspondingly, any updates to the plan and/or data should be distributed to the entire team, even if the updates may not necessarily be applicable to all of the team. The purpose behind this (in much the same vein as the communication issue discussed above) is to ensure that nothing is missed and to allow everyone the opportunity for input that may actually help the project.</p>

alt="" />Next week, Magenic is hosting a new event titled the BI Summit.  This event is a focus point on the decision makers and the team players that hold key factual aspects in how a company attacks Business Intelligence.  Magenic has long been a monster of a custom development consulting company with monster names at its disposal.  The side that Magenic is now showing is the data services and business intelligence aspects to all its offerings.  With the BI Summit, this is where Magenic will show off both, the skills capable of being offered as well as the newest involvement and technological advancements Microsoft has made in BI and SQL Server.</p>
<p>The Magenic BI Summit will be on August 23<sup>rd</sup>, next Thursday.  There will be a great base of presentations and speakers.  Aaron Lowe and I will be presenting on presentation layers and the overall data visualization abilities easily implemented with SQL Server and features that follow with SQL Server.  The event will be from 7:30 AM to around noon.  Given the half day concept, we hope you all make the attendance and eagerly get back into work to share all the great things we’ll be showing off.</p>

alt="" />The second event, yes Magenic is going all Chicago event crazy this year, is the Code Mastery event.  The BI Summit enlists the decision makers while the <a href="http://codemastery.com/chicago/">Code Mastery</a> will take everything discussed at the BI Summit, as well as much more, and put it down and get into the technical side of things.  The Code Mastery event will be an all-day event much like the successful SQL Saturday events.  The difference Code Mastery will be bringing is a combination of SQL Server and .NET Development sessions.  This way Magenic delivers to a group of professionals that both cross SQL Server and development as well as focus on one specific technology.</p>
<p>Chicago Code Mastery will be held on September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2012 and consume the entire day, packed full of expert technical presentations from Query Tuning in SQL Server to iOS application migration to Windows 8.  There will also be four Microsoft MVPs on-site and presenting!</p>
<p><a href="http://codemastery.com/">Magenic Code Mastery</a> events aren’t a new event and have shown great success nationally.  This is another reason Magenic Chicago is very excited to be hosting one of these events.  I encourage you to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4019769238?ref=ebtnebregn">register soon</a> as seats will undoubtedly fill quickly!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I left college, I believed that projects would be clearly defined in a functional specification (despite my actual experience up to that point). The grand purpose of the project would be detailed, the goals and assumptions would be written and indexed, and the expectations for uptime, performance, and similar non-functional requirements would be included. In short, I would know exactly what needed to be produced in order to call the project &#8220;complete&#8221;.</p>
<p>A little later I was introduced to the idea of a project charter, a brief 2-page document that simply outlined the goals and expectations of a project, a <i>&#8220;what will you have when I&#8217;m done&#8221;</i> document.  This did a better job, throwing out the crystal ball and admitting that it only knew the goals and some constraints, not the details of how it would look when we got there. </p>
<p>At some point I was introduced to XP user stories and defining the user&#8217;s expectations as acceptance criteria at the feature level, focusing on small distinct pieces of work and providing the necessary level of detail at the last responsible moment.</p>
<p>And at some point, after an on-again, off-again relationship with unit testing, I was able to use TDD and BDD on projects, both of which work at even lower levels, defining what the behavior will be of a feature or code unit when it&#8217;s code complete.</p>
<h2>Definition of Done</h2>
<p>The consistent thread through the lessons above was defining what &#8220;done&#8221; means at a project, feature, behavior, or code unit level. </p>
<p>A requirements document provides a very deep definition of what the project will look like when it is complete. Unfortunately this only works if you will have a limited need to make changes along the way. Often what we think we need up front requires some hands on use to see what we overlooked, whether the hypothesized feature helps us meet the goal as we expected it to, and whether it makes to our end user.</p>
<p>A simple project overview, like the charter above, can provide the overall goals and the general shape of the solution, without trying to dive too deep into the mechanics of how they will be achieved. It defines the goals of our project, serves as a measurement to determine if we are done, and helps prioritize the features we are going to implement.</p>
<p>User Stories operate at a lower level, defining a single feature and what the end users expectations are for that feature. User stories detail expectations from the end users perspective, so discussing or prioritizing them with an end user occurs in terminology they are familiar with. User Stories provide us with the &#8220;Why&#8221; and room to ask deeper questions.</p>
<p>With BDD or TDD we define what done means at an individual interaction or code unit level and can then create code that meets that definition. They provide confirmation that we have built exactly what we have set out to build, that we have met our definition of done, and that we will have some protection from derailing that work later on. </p>
<h2>Multiple Facets of Done-ness</h2>
<p>As critical as it is to understand what the customer or end user is actually asking us for, having a good definition of &#8220;Done&#8221; doesn&#8217;t stop with the customer&#8217;s direct expectations. We also have non-functional requirements that apply to large portions of the project as well as internal processes and practices, all of which should be considered when defining what &#8220;Done&#8221; means at a specific level.</p>
<h3>Non-functional Requirements</h3>
<p>Non-functional requirements span across many or all of the features we build into the system and can be difficult to track. Part of creating a definition of &#8220;Done&#8221; for a feature should include scanning the list of known non-functional requirements and adding the appropriate ones to the list. </p>
<p>Building an AJAX feature on a web page that talks to a 3rd party web service? Probably need to include the general requirements around responsiveness of the browser page and how to degrade or error out the service when the 3rd party service inevitably goes missing.</p>
<h3>Process and Practices</h3>
<p>We probably have a process we want our features to follow as we build them. In some cases this might be so easy it doesn&#8217;t need to be included, in others we might have a more complex process we need to follow. A feature isn&#8217;t done at &#8220;coded and thrown over the wall&#8221;, if there are quality steps, levels of unit test coverage, static analysis to prevent us from dirtying up the codebase, and so on, those should be included in our definition of &#8220;Done&#8221;.</p>
<p>Along with our ongoing process, we can also use the definition to drive longer term changes into our process or codebase. Want to add test coverage to a legacy project? Add a requirement that completing a new feature requires meeting a target test coverage and 3 tests in an older part of the code base. </p>
<p>Being &#8220;Done&#8221; with a feature means the feature is ready for delivery and we won&#8217;t be coming back to it in 6 months to try to bolt-on performance improvements to meet metrics we knew about in the beginning.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Definition</h2>
<p>Why are we spending so much time on something that seems like just extra work?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference between <i>&#8220;I know what we have to do, lets just go do it&#8221;</i> and having a good definition of &#8220;Done&#8221;. If it is truly that obvious, making a quick bullet list will only take about 5 minutes. If it takes longer, it wasn&#8217;t as obvious as we thought and we&#8217;ve already uncovered some benefit.</p>
<p><b>End User Context:</b> Having the end end user define their expectations helps uncover the parts that are obvious to them, but foreign to us as IT people, employees of a different company, whatever. This also helps us build something that better fits the end users needs and expectations and provides us with information we need to help them make good technical decisions.</p>
<p><b>Focus:</b> With a definition of done, we have a laser focus on what needs to be done. Instead of building a general solution to meet what we think they think they want, we can build directly towards their criteria. That&#8217;s not to say we&#8217;re going to get it perfect on the first iteration, but we can build a leaner solution that more directly meets their expectations. This means fewer iterations and corrections with a smaller and easier to modify code base.</p>
<p><b>Get Stuff Done:</b> Ever get on one of those projects where it feels like it just kind of keeps on sluggishly flowing past and tasks are only done if no one has asked about them in a couple weeks? Yeah, I&#8217;ve been there too. Having a definition of done not only helps you better define when it hits that magic &#8220;Done&#8221; moment, but also keeps those one day tasks from turning into 6 month, under the radar, mini-marathon projects. Want an additional feature on top of the original one? We can totally do that too, but lets make a task for it so I can make sure I understand and capture your expectations. That other task is done, done, done.</p>
<p><b>Prioritization:</b> How important is &#8220;add a button and text input to screen X&#8221;? Yeah, I don&#8217;t know either. So how are we going to get the end user to help prioritize these things without someone pulling out the &#8220;they&#8217;re all number one&#8221; phrase? Instead of trying to prioritize screens and buttons, the end user is prioritizing their own needs and expectations. This can help the end user prioritize, consider scope reduction of less necessary features, or potentially modifying a deadline to get all of the truly critical elements.</p>
<p><b>Bake Enough Quality In:</b> Whatever your non-functional or process criteria are, trying to add them at the end of the project rarely works out well. If you need a certain level of performance, make this part of the criteria along the way. Afraid the focus will shift from getting things done to premature performance tuning? Create a looser &#8220;acceptable performance&#8221; level that is used during the main development, then tune from there afterwards. We don&#8217;t want to waste time on premature optimization, but without at least a minimum acceptable bar you will quickly find out just how horrendously slow something can be written to run.</p>
<p><b>Don&#8217;t Bake Too Much Quality In:</b> A lack of definition doesn&#8217;t automatically make everyone faster, the opposite can happen as well. Without a definition, each person on the project (and the customer) is left to define their own level for non-functional or process criteria. These are not likely to be the same. So the customer has one non-communicated level of performance expectations, the project manager has another. One developer is slamming code out as fast as they can with &#8220;as long as it compiles&#8221; as a performance bar, another is spending days trying to squeeze an extra 10ms out of a process. Defining &#8220;Done&#8221; in this case not only helps raise the bar and communicate consistent expectations, it also frees up time from any of the members of the team that have more stringent personal definitions they fall back on. </p>
<h2>&#8220;Done&#8221; for the post</h2>
<p>This post was inspired by posts from Howard (not published yet?) and Alex (<a title="Bad Medicine - How Prescription Becomes a Problem in User Stories" href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/bad-medicine-how-prescription-becomes">Bad Medicine &#8211; How Prescription Becomes a Problem in User Stories</a>) as well as ongoing conversations we&#8217;ve been having. </p>
<p>It may seem like wasted effort to put a definition of &#8220;Done&#8221; together, but I have yet to see an environment where the long term cost wasn&#8217;t much greater (and my personal IT experience spans consulting engagements, 4 SaaS products, and over 75 projects). Not every website needs to load at Google search speeds, but the team needs to have a clear bar to aim for, even if that is &#8220;under ten seconds&#8221;, and the customer needs to know and be OK with this bar. </p>
<p>A definition of &#8220;Done&#8221; doesn&#8217;t need to have crystal clear requirements in infinite detail, &#8220;web-scale&#8221; performance guidelines, and so on. Be pragmatic. It&#8217;s more important that the end user expectations are captured and understood, that the relevant non-functional requirements (when the 3rd party service goes down, so does our entire product, and it&#8217;s OK) are included, and that somewhere we have captured the teams expectations for practices and process. Aim for just enough and be aware you will still have surprises.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I set out to get SQL Saturday in Wisconsin organized.  It was a goal of mine that I really wanted to achieve.  Alas, time and other things got in the way of me doing that on my own.  Conflicts with other SQL Saturdays, working on a few books, and then venue issues put the task to the side.  Organizing something like a SQL Saturday alone with a large market to cater to is next to exhausting.  I learned that very quickly.  I should have known this from helping on the last two SQL Saturdays in Chicago.  What can I say?  Sometimes I try to do more than 5-hour energy drinks can allow me to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/media/blogs/ITProfessionals/sqlcowtipping.gif?mtime=1322861751"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/sqlcowtipping.gif?mtime=1322861751" alt="" width="402" height="278" /></a></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, 2012 is going to be completely different because it is being done right!  Or, I should say, I’m not doing it alone.  Jes Borland (<a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;author=420">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/grrl_geek">Twitter</a>) decided to take it upon herself to bring the topic of a Wisconsin held SQL Saturday up again.  This time, she did it right by gathering a group of people by using the Madison SQL Server User Group (MADPASS) to find the people that could help organize it.  Jes also asked for my help in organizing and I jumped at the chance to be part of the event.  We, in Wisconsin, have a great SQL Server Community and it is just begging to explode into a year of packed events, user group expansions and gatherings.  From Milwaukee to Green Bay and across to Madison, there are SQL Server Professionals that I know are out there simply based on business growth.  These professionals are just waiting to find the community and expand it as well as their own skills and abilities to lead us as a community.</p>
<p>SQL Saturday in Wisconsin will also be scheduled in line with SQL Saturday in Chicago.  I will be helping organize the Chicago event again and we all worked together to keep the events in a well-planned time frame.  This means, SQL Saturday will be available to this area twice a year!  That’s double the free training to your employers.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I’m also a Regional Mentor for PASS.  My region, the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/PASSChapters/USNorthCentral.aspx">North-Central Region</a>, doesn’t cover Wisconsin but I still think of my home state as part of it.  In all, being a regional mentor spans the entire world.  Anywhere PASS reaches and anywhere it doesn’t and potential exists for it to spark user groups and events like SQL Saturday, is part of the PASS region.  My partner mentor for the NC region is Jason Strate (<a href="http://www.jasonstrate.com/">Blog</a>|<a href="http://twitter.com/stratesql">Twitter </a>).  Jason came up with another exciting idea of expanding our region by doing SQL Saturday events in areas that have great potential but simply may not have the vast amount of SQL Server Community there.  Yet!  With that being said, Jason and I are working on organizing events like this in places such as Fargo, ND.  There is a lot more to a SQL Saturday when it comes to <em>remotely </em>organizing them.  You need local support of course.  I think with what Jason came up with for doing these events in these locations is how we can take SQL Saturday to a new level, and at the same time, bring it back to the roots of what it was all about.  Look for Fargo, ND to hold a SQL Saturday in the future.  From there we have no barriers and plan to expand the reaches to everyone.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to congratulate Sheila Acker on creating and leading the new NC PASS Chapter, Quad Cities Iowa, and Phil Milner on the St. Louis BI User Group.  I’ve had the pleasure of talking to Sheila at several events including SQL Saturday in Iowa and the PASS Summit.  I know she is going to do an awesome job leading this new chapter and I can’t wait to work with her as a regional mentor.   As always, you can get <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/Community/PASSBlog/entryid/388/Community-Update.aspx">community updates</a> on sqlpass.org.</p>

<p>Remember, SQL Saturday in Wisconsin is just a short drive away!</p>
<p>Iowa City – 175 Miles, 3 hours 22 minutes</p>
<p>Minneapolis – 269 Miles, 4 hours 50 minutes</p>
<p>Milwaukee – 79 Miles, 1 hour 34 Minutes</p>
<p>Chicago – 148 Miles, 2 hours 48 minutes (or for you IL drivers, 148 Miles, 1 hour <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Green Bay – 135 Miles, 2 hours 28 Minutes</p>
<p>And many more small to large cities within driving distance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that is fairly important when writing articles, blogs, whitepapers or even authoring books is ensuring you do not share any personal information in your screen captures.  This is even more important when you are using company property to make your screen captures.</p>
<p>Now, on some occasions, leaving connections to SQL Server or Security context is ok.  For example, I’ve used Fred and God commonly as SQL Authenticated Logins to my instances.  Those two accounts are something I picked and kept to over the years.  This can be done with named instances also.  You can install and name a SQL Server something comical, meaningful or encrypted.  <em>“Connect to your instance named, SomeCrasyMessedUpMachineHolySmokesSQLIsCool”.</em></p>
<p>But getting back to topic; you really want to make sure you never leave a trace of anything that you do not purposely intend to use, like above.</p>
<p>Here is how I remove these potentially, incriminating names.</p>
<p>Download <a href="http://paint.net/">PAINT.NET</a>.  Paint.net is a free image editor that is extremely valuable.  For years I used Photo Shop and for years my wallet was empty due to it.  Now, Photo Shop does have a lot of very advanced options that Paint.net doesn’t but at my level for writing, those options will never be touched.  So Paint.net filled a hole where cost and needed abilities were completely met.</p>
<p>After installing Paint.net, I recommend installing the <a href="http://paint.net.amihotornot.com.au/Download/PluginsPack/">Megalo Effects Plugin Pack</a>. You get dozens of really cool effects and options for editing in more advanced ways.  For this tip, those will not be used but again, highly recommended.</p>
<p>Using Windows 7 Snipping Tool, take a screen capture of a login properties window opened from SSMS.  (Note: I marked out the real values in Server and Connection still. You can do that with Paint.net too!)</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-3.png?mtime=1320411554"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-3.png?mtime=1320411554" width="318" height="284" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>We’re going to edit Fred in this case.  The properties that we would not want to share to the public are Server and Connection.  These properties will show domain logins and SQL Server Instance names.  You would be surprised how many Server values I’ve seen that were full IP addresses that I could ping and I could actual connect to.  Those instances were placed online and exposed extremely poorly and a massive security risk to networks and even, home machines.</p>
<p><strong>Removal with Paint.net</strong></p>
<p>To remove these values, click the cropping icon in the Tools box in Paint.net.</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-4.png?mtime=1320411554"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-4.png?mtime=1320411554" width="67" height="97" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>Now, select the area you need to remove and hit Delete on your keyboard.</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-5.png?mtime=1320411554"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-5.png?mtime=1320411554" width="276" height="171" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-6.png?mtime=1320411554"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-6.png?mtime=1320411554" width="235" height="145" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>We need to make this look better because the world is going to see it.  To do this we want to first, sample the color area that the value we just removed was in and then using the paint bucket, fill that area with the selected color.</p>
<p>Select the Color Picker icon in the toolbox</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-7.png?mtime=1320411554"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-7.png?mtime=1320411554" width="91" height="99" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>Move the color picker over the gray area next to Server: and click the area.  This selects the color exactly the way it is in the image.</p>
<p>Next, select the Paint Bucket icon in the toolbox.</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-8.png?mtime=1320411610"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-8.png?mtime=1320411610" width="77" height="98" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>Move the paint bucket icon over the areas that were cropped and click the area.</p>
<p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-9.png?mtime=1320411611"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/-9.png?mtime=1320411611" width="245" height="133" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>At this point you have a clean image that is not distracting to what you are trying to write about and looks professional.</p>
<p>Happy writing!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">As I was cleaning this past weekend, I did inventory of hardware that was floating about the house and it turns out that I have four laptops and one desktop.  The desktop that I still have is one that I built around four years ago.  It is up in the guest room primarily used by my two sons for school and games.  This started me thinking about where we are today with computing, and desktop computing specifically.  Five or so years ago, a laptop was far under powered in all areas of resources to handle running the number of instances of SQL Server and or Virtual Machines that come with the typical SQL Server Professionals daily routine of learning and testing.  You could go out and spend $4000 to get a laptop that was 5 inches thick and would burn the hair off your legs, but we’re being realistic for the normal geek here.  Today, we have it a bit different.  At a reasonable price of $1000, you can go out and purchase a solid laptop with enough disk, CPU power and memory to successfully install, configure and run SQL Server Developer.  Add a few hundred to that and you are running SSD drives for your data and log files and you are screaming fast in a lot of areas of SQL Server loaded on a laptop. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only can you run this successfully but you can run it and properly gauge a performance baseline by creating a simple formula from the laptop executions and port them to server hardware. Now, that in no way is a replacement of a well formed landscape consisting of a Development, Test, User Acceptance Testing and Production transport system.  Really, about the only problem you have to worry about are burns from the laptop if you actually leave it on your lap. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">So why buy a desktop? </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">I hear the arguments coming in…I can pack a desktop full of more memory, disk and dual physical processors and…</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">OK.  You can do that and I’ve built such desktops.  But, do you need it?  Nope.  I’m walking proof of that.  I run seven SQL Server instances from a laptop and VMWare Workstation running a few more virtual machines.  This is all for writing, testing, learning and presenting.  This is being all done without much, if any, problems in the overall speed of my laptop.  The laptop is a more expensive one.  I think around $1700.  But it is still less than the cost of building that desktop mentioned earlier. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">There it is: Desktop Computing is dead!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #000000;">Desktop Computing is so dead that most people I know that really need to beat on SQL Server or other server related software, run servers at home for it.  Yes, servers can really be cost effective and in a lot of cases, you can pick a decent Gen 2 or 3 servers up for the same price, again, as the monster desktop you would have to build.</span></span></p>
