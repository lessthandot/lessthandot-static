(I&#8217;m not lying, <a href="/index.php/author/koenverbeeck/">check for yourself</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/100.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3483 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/100-300x210.jpg" alt="100" width="300" height="210" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/100-300x210.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/100-1024x718.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/100.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I started blogging at the end of 2012, almost 3 years ago and it has been an amazing ride so far. I&#8217;ve apparently gathered almost 1.5 million views (I don&#8217;t really trust that figure :)) and 260 comments.  My most popular blog post is <a href="/index.php/datamgmt/ssis/stupid-me-3-building-the/">Stupid me #3 – Building the script component</a> with almost 100,000 views. For some reason. I still don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s the most popular post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I learned a lot while blogging and I still believe it&#8217;s a very powerful method for personal development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">However, sometimes nice things come to an end. I&#8217;m not talking about blogging itself, but about the blog here at LessthanDot. I&#8217;m moving my blog to my own website: <a href="http://sqlkover.com/">SQLKover</a>. (<strong>Ko</strong>en <strong>Ver</strong>beeck if you are wondering)<br />
After 100 blog posts, it&#8217;s time for something new and that little something is a brand new website. I&#8217;ll continue to blog over there, but I will keep my account over here so I can still answer on comments on my old blog posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I&#8217;d like to thank the LTD team for giving me the opportunity to blog for all those years and for their excellent support. I&#8217;d especially like to thank Chrissie (<a href="/index.php/author/chrissie1/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissie1">twitter</a>) since he&#8217;s the one who convinced me to start blogging in the first place (and has had to put up with my annoying questions the most). I wish the whole LTD team and their bloggers the best of luck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I&#8217;d like to thank you, dear reader, as well for reading all my ramblings for so long. I hope I can welcome you at my new blog <a href="http://sqlkover.com/">SQLKover</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thanks and regards,<br />
Koen</p>

<blockquote><p>The Tribal Awards, co-hosted by Simple-Talk and SQLServerCentral, seek to recognize outstanding members of the SQL community. We want to highlight people who are currently leaders due to their writing, speaking, or general community presence.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the previous edition, I was nominated for <em>Best New Community Voice</em>, however this year I am very pleased to announce that this blog has made the final in the category <em>Best Blog of the Year</em>!<br />
It&#8217;s a great honour, especially when you consider the other finalists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brent Ozar</li>
<li>Paul Randal</li>
<li>Thomas LaRock</li>
<li>Pinal Dave</li>
</ul>
<p>Suffice to say I am a little bit of the underdog here. With this blog post, I encourage you to go to the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TribalAwards2014SSC">Tribal Awards voting page</a> and vote for this blog. There are other categories as well, with a lot of community champions featured in them. Please take your time to vote for these people as well, they all deserve it.</p>
<p>A very big thanks for all of the people who nominated this blog, it means a lot to me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/2014/champagne.jpg?mtime=1389043764"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/2014/champagne.jpg?mtime=1389043764" width="156" height="157" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a bit late with the almost obligatory “How was my past year and how do I think next year is going to rock” blog post – we’re already a good week into the new year – but without further ado I present you: How was my past year and how do I think next year is going to rock!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify;">2013 was not a bad year professional wise. I had set some goals and I managed to reach most of them (which is quite a miracle, because I excel at abandoning New Year’s resolutions at the very first chance possible). I laid those goals out in the blog post </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/other/happy-holidays">Happy Holidays</a><span style="text-align: justify;">. I read more technical books. Not 12 like I wanted to, but almost 10. Those books were the following:</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20pt; list-style-position: outside;">
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Server-2012-Analysis-Services/dp/0735658188/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356599212&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tabular+modeling+ssas">Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services: The BISM Tabular Model</a> by Marco Russo, Alberto Ferrari and Chris Webb. It’s a great reference on the SSAS Tabular model and DAX, but it is sometimes a difficult read.</li>
<li>Information Dashboard Design, Data Visualization: a successful design process and Say it with Charts. I wrote a review about those 3 books <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/book-review/data-visualization-book-review">here</a>. Three great books who got me up to speed with data visualization. In the summer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-At---Glance/dp/1938377001/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040589&amp;sr=8-1">second edition</a> of Information Dashboard Design came out and I immediately bought it and read it front to cover. It’s a great book and offers a few extras over the first edition.</li>
<li>I was browsing a local book store and I found those two books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Intelligence-Microsoft-Techniques-Visualizing/dp/1118388038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040636&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mark+stacey">Visual Intelligence: Microsoft Tools and Techniques for Visualizing Data</a> by Mark Stacey, Joe Salvatore and Adam Jorgensen and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Excel-Charts-Graphs-MrExcel-Library/dp/0789748622/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040735&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=excel+charts">Excel 2013 Charts and Graphs</a> by Bill Jelen. Actually I just went home and bought the books at Amazon, because those local bookstores sure aren’t cheap. I had the pleasure of meeting Mark in person at the Belgian SQL Server Days and he’s an awesome chap. It’s a great book he wrote and I absolutely recommend it as a great overview of all the Microsoft BI visualization options. It even gives you a taste of HTML5. Sadly, Power BI was announced after the release of the book. The Excel book was quite nice as well. A bit dry, but a very good reference if you want to find out what you can do with Excel (a lot).</li>
<li>Also in the summer time a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Dimensional/dp/1118530802/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389040993&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=data+warehouse+toolkit">new edition of the Data Warehouse Toolkit</a> by Ralph Kimball was released. I read it and it was great to freshen up my knowledge on dimensional design. If you didn’t read any of the previous editions yet, this book is an absolute must-read.</li>
<li>Since my (ex-) colleague Valentino did the technical review, I was very keen to do a <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/ssrs/reporting-services-blueprints">review</a> of the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sql-server-2012-reporting-services-blueprints/book?utm_source=mention.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=book_mention.com">SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services Blueprints</a>. A very fast read and great to get up to speed with SSRS.</li>
<li>I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Balanced-Scorecard-Translating-Strategy/dp/0875846513/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389041329&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=balanced+scorecard">The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action</a> by Robert Kaplan and David Norton. It is a fundamental book regarding scorecards and performance management, but it was way too “financial” for me (read: I almost fell asleep reading the book). So I gave up half-way. No shame in that, I might finish it in the future when I’m overdosing on Red Bull.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently I started the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Schema-The-Complete-Reference/dp/0071744320/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389041477&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=star+schema">Star Schema The Complete Reference</a> by Chris Adamson. It was recommended by a colleague and it looks very promising. This will be my first book of 2014 and I hope I can reach 12 books in total.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the other goals: I got the <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/MSSQLServer/how-i-prepared-mcse">MCSE certification</a>, learned a lot about SQL Server 2012,<a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/other/the-times-they-are-a"> changed jobs and started writing articles</a>. The blog went all right in my opinion: I managed to squeak out 40 blog posts, with the most popular blog post at the time of writing being <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/business-intelligence-1/sql-2014-ctp1-where-is">SQL 2014 CTP1, where is my BIDS?</a> with over 31000 views for the moment. I had a couple of beers when I wrote that post, so this seems to be worth for further investigation to see if I can repeat that success formula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What does the year bring in 2014, aside from the 20-year anniversary of Kurt Cobains death? (Yes, we are that old). I will try to keep this blog running of course, next to the articles, and I will try to present again at a few events. SQL Server 2014 is coming up, so I’m sure there will be plenty of stuff to learn and discover. I will also try to get a better grip on data vault modelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, thanks for reading all those posts in 2013 and I hope you return in the following year. Have a great 2014!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve been notified I am a finalist for the category <em>Best New Voice</em> at the <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/blogs/2013/12/08/tribal-awards/">Tribal Awards</a>. These awards are not for some tattoos on your lower back or on your biceps, but rather a collaboration of Simple-Talk and SQLServerCentral to give outstanding community contributors the chance to receive a round of applause by their fellow peers. That’s right, nomination is entirely done by the tech community itself (and I somehow seemed to miss that survey).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have the incredible honour to have been nominated and apparently so enough time to land me a spot in the finals. I’d appreciate it if you, dear reader, could find the time <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TribalAwardsVoting">to vote</a>. Not only for myself (my ego is already big enough), but for other excellent people as well, such as the fine SQLServerCentral forum dwellers like Gail (who needs a new custome), Paul, Jeff, Grant and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers,<br /> Koen</p>

<p>Most software seems to have lost sight of what it is trying to achieve or has chosen mediocrity in order to kick something out the door and label the work &#8220;done&#8221;. Unfortunately this is the kind of &#8220;done&#8221; that ends in contract and scope arguments, with overtime paid to the developers and a customer unable to do critical parts of their business. That kind of &#8220;done&#8221;.</p>
<p>The purpose of software is to do work for systems or people. </p>
<h2>Do Work for People</h2>
<p>Software that is built for people needs to work for people. Far to often software is built with a focus on a dry technical spec or imagined user, but the real user one day putting hands on the software and using it is left completely out of the equation. Rather than treating it as a future extension of the users hand, we get all the functionality in and then attempt to bend the user to fit the software through training or attempting to add usability as magic icing after the software is done.</p>
<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: .5em;">
When the iPod came on the market, there was already a number of competing MP3 players, it wasn&#8217;t a groundbreaking piece of technology. What set the iPod apart was it&#8217;s ease of use. It showed us how easy it could be to transfer a CD to our music player, to have a whole music store at our fingertips and ready to be transferred into our device, and that a highly technical device could have easy to touch and use controls. What set the iPod apart was the focus on making things as easy and obvious as possible for the user, rather than the competitions focus on making a product with a complex instruction sheet, non-integrated software experience, and so on.
</div>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that when you build a piece of software that is technically marvelous and considers the user only as an afterthought, someone like me will get on twitter and tell you your product sucks to use. No matter how wondrous it is behind the scenes, if I can&#8217;t understand the instructions, if it requires weeks of training with every release, if I am the least bit nervous about which button to chose to save my work, then your software does not work for me.</p>
<p>The purpose of software is to do work for systems and people. If I can&#8217;t figure out how to make it do work, it sucks, regardless of the internals.</p>
<h2>Do Work for Systems</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re living in an age of APIs and SDKs. It&#8217;s the world envisioned by the early adopters of SOAP 15 years ago, when every company or service would have external APIs we could consume. It&#8217;s a world that started when the first programmer sat down to write a program that interacted with another program. A lot of this world sucks too.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to learn that the intended end user of an API or SDK is not the system. It&#8217;s a developer. And just like the previous case, the API or SDK should be designed to help the developer get work done. Except that, once again, the technical implementation often ends up being the focus, with the external interfaces just being nailed on any old way. </p>
<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: .5em;">
I work regularly with the Microsoft Azure API and the .Net Azure SDK. They are both well documented and have numerous examples posted. I&#8217;ve also built my own SDK to consume the API, as well as some one-off chunks of code that interact directly with the API. When I have a choice, I use my own SDK over Microsoft&#8217;s. This is not because I&#8217;m smarter or more technically proficient (I&#8217;m not), but because my SDK is easier to use, provides better feedback to the rest of the application, is consistent with the API and API documentation, and in many cases requires exactly one method call for each action I want to do against the API.</p>
<p>The Microsoft SDK has clumsier interfaces, requires a second set of instructions, requires extra abstraction work to allow me to write unit tests for my own code, &#8230; it&#8217;s the generic MP3 player before iPods ate their cake.
</p></div>
<p>Systems software is typically considered to be easier and free of all that people stuff. Except it really isn&#8217;t, it just has a different set of users. The ability for systems software to do work is still very much reliant on the ability for developers to use that bit of software from their future bit of software.</p>
<h2>Do Work</h2>
<p>But at least we have the technical, people-free portion of the work handled, right? </p>
<p>That depends on your definition of actually &#8220;working&#8221;, which has two key issues: honesty and understanding.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Work</h3>
<p>Too many companies draw up a scope of exactly what the customer says they need, then methodically try to deliver exactly that scope. Some waterfall, some iterate, and at the end of the contract they beat their customers into submission with that scope. Because that&#8217;s the easy way to do it.</p>
<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: .5em;">
I once worked on a hugely overdue project to deliver a piece of line-of-business software to a company that we hoped would become an ongoing revenue stream. We had a high level scope and someone had pulled some deadlines out of thin air, it was roughly 9 months into a one year deadline and the customer hadn&#8217;t seen the software yet. All of it was designed and built from weekly phone calls and that initial scope document, with prototyped sample images that we later found out had a high level of artistic license and low level of accuracy. The customer had some very real pain points, but we had a document that explained exactly what we were going to deliver. </p>
<p>Relations were strained, the customer had gone out on a limb for this project and we kept delivering badly interpreted versions of what he was asking for after not showing him anything for months at a time but an envelope with a bill in it. </p>
<p>The software sucked. And not just because of all the quality problems, performance problems, build problems, integration problems, usability problems, and things we created that they never asked for. It sucked because it was so focused on solving an abstracted, prototyped, guestimated version of the customers process that it totally overlooked the work that needed to be done as well as the genuine pain points that we could have focused on in far less time for far greater effect.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t work and it didn&#8217;t solve the right problems.
</p></div>
<p>The purpose of software is to do work, if it does the wrong work, then no matter how technically sound or brilliant, it sucks. And if you missed the purpose, you probably didn&#8217;t make it very easy to use either, so good luck with that.</p>
<h3>Honest Work</h3>
<p>Down to the wire, the software has to be delivered next month, and there&#8217;s still 3 outstanding features and a slew of bugs. We&#8217;ll just ship what we have and if they have any problems with it we&#8217;ll have the lawyers point out that we technically delivered what the spec said we would. Point out where it says we can&#8217;t charge you to fix the bugs preventing it from running.</p>
<p>What crap.</p>
<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: .5em;">
That project I mentioned above? They chose the features because we told the customer it would have X, Y,and Z, so we have to ship X, Y, and Z. We&#8217;ll ignore the fact that the save button on X takes over 30 seconds and occasionally mangles the data, that the page for Y only works for half the users, and prior features like A, B, and C still have outstanding issues from months before. We shipped it, it must be done.
</div>
<p>We are delivering tools to do a job, if it doesn&#8217;t work then it doesn&#8217;t work. Delivering it that way and hoping that the customer won&#8217;t notice? Fraud.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying every piece of software has to be delivered bug free, what I&#8217;m saying is to be honest about your work. And in the case above, honesty means owning up to the customer that you will not be able to deliver what you promised and now have to chose between fixing these 3 broken features or adding 3 more. Which is painful, I&#8217;ve had to have that conversation before, but lying by delivering a mass of unworking software is for charlatans, not professionals.</p>
<p>The purpose of software is to do work, if it doesn&#8217;t function then it doesn&#8217;t do the work.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s About People</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, software is about people and too much software forgets that. Even the code we write should be written for future developers to read and improve upon, covered in unit tests to provide a safety net for future development, revised and improved upon as we gain a better understanding of the goals of the work the user wants to do or as we find better ways for them to interact with the software. And I haven&#8217;t even mentioned all the non-code aspects of good software, like the importance of good support and communications.</p>
<p>The purpose of software is to do work for systems and people. For people and by people. Miss that and random tweets are the least of your worries, it won&#8217;t take the next iPod to eat your lunch, just a mediocre application that gets some of that equation right.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This blog post will not be about Bob Dylan, but rather about some professional changes/challenges I’ve been up to lately.</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="http://www.element61.be/" href="http://www.element61.be/"><img style="float: left;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/timeschanging/e61_v8.png?mtime=1383041522" alt="" width="161" height="70" /></a></p>
<p>The most important one is my switch to a new employer. After almost 3 years being happily employed at Ordina Belgium, I’ll move to <a href="http://www.element61.be/">element61</a> in November. element61 is a Performance Management and Business Intelligence consultancy firm. From their website: “<em>element61 is the thought-leading Business Analytics, Performance Management and Financial Reporting consulting company in the Belgian marketplace. Today, element61 has brought together the most experienced team in Performance Management, BI &amp; data warehousing in Belgium. The company has grown in 6 years to about 36 senior consultants with -on average- 12 years of experience in PM &amp; BI, totaling over 425 man years of experience</em>”.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">element61 encourages its employees to write articles – called Insights – for their website. There are really interesting pieces about various aspects of BI and PM, and they are not restricted to a single vendor. There are insights about SQL Server, but also about SAP, Cognos, Business Objects or about general topics such as data quality. You can find an overview </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://www.element61.be/e/resourc.asp?ResourceTypeId=22">here</a><span style="text-align: justify;">. I’ll probably write some insights too in the future and I’ll let you know when one is published.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main reason for my move is the extremely talented and experienced team of element61. I’ll definitely learn a lot from them in my time there and I look forward to joining the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: justify;"><a title="http://resources.intenseschool.com/" href="http://resources.intenseschool.com/"><img style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/timeschanging/IntenseSchool_logo.gif?mtime=1383041520" alt="" width="204" height="33" /></a></p>
<p>The second change is that I have started writing technical articles for two websites. The technical content is still SQL Server of course, focused on business intelligence and Integration Services in particular. The first site is the resource page of <a href="http://resources.intenseschool.com/">Intense School</a>. Intense School is a training provider, offering accelerated IT trainings (classroom, on-site and on-line) from different vendors, such as Cisco, Microsoft, Red Hat and so on. They were looking to expand their resource page on SQL Server, and that’s where I came into the picture. I have already written two articles for their site. The first is a two-part piece on how to implement slowly changing dimensions in SSIS, exploring the various possibilities and alternatives: <a href="http://resources.intenseschool.com/four-methods-for-implementing-a-slowly-changing-dimension-in-integration-services-part-i/">part I</a> and <a href="http://resources.intenseschool.com/four-methods-for-implementing-a-slowly-changing-dimension-in-integration-services-part-ii/">part II</a>. The second article is a collection of tips for starting SSIS developers: <a href="http://resources.intenseschool.com/5-tips-to-make-you-a-pro-ssis-developer/">5 tips to make you a pro SSIS developer</a>. For more information about the services offered by Intense School, you can visit <a href="http://www.intenseschool.com/">their website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: justify;"><a title="www.mssqltips.com" href="http://www.mssqltips.com/"><img style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/timeschanging/mssqltips_logo.png?mtime=1383041521" alt="" width="105" height="70" /></a>The second site is a well-known resource hub for SQL Server related articles: <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/">MSSQLTips.com</a>. Obviously the tips I will write will be about SQL Server. I’m joining an extraordinary team of writers and I’m proud to be a part of it. I already have on tip published: <a href="http://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3072/sql-server-integration-services-ssis-transactions-without-msdtc/">SQL Server Integration Services SSIS Transactions without MSDTC</a>. I’m currently working on a 3-part introductory to BIML, so keep your eye on their website.</div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">A lot of writing ahead, but don’t worry, I’ll still update this blog.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers,<br /> Koen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology is a wonderful tool that should make all of our lives better &#8211; at least until Skynet takes over. But then I am hoping that this article will serve me in good stead with our new superior overlords.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The problem, as you may have guessed by now, is that far too often we find that technology often frustrates us as much as it serves to benefit. Beyond the work software that we use that simply never functions as well as we think it should (Microsoft Office, anyone?) are the increasing multitude of apps that are available for pc&#8217;s, tablets and smartphones that either perform nowhere near to expectations or behave in odd fashions that we would not expect.</p>
<p>For example, I am an avid fan of Spotify, the streaming music service. I love it and have it installed on my desktop, laptop, iPad and now iPhone (as well as on my beloved Android that I recently exchanged for work reasons). It works wonderfully on my two computers. It is functional (in my opinion) on the iPad and similar on the iPhone (though I haven&#8217;t done as much with it there just yet) and flat out unusable on my old Android. Making it worse is the fact that I pay $10/month for this service and can&#8217;t really use it as well as I want on all of my devices. Yet, with a few tweaks (all of which I have found suggested on Spotify&#8217;s forums), I think it could be even better. I seriously considered giving up the service but continue to hold out hope that it will fix those last few issues to make it a better experience.</p>
<p>And, in the end, all of the software that we use is for the experience as much for the convenience. If we have a bad experience or the convenience is not what we think it should be, we are less likely to pay money for it again. This holds true for non-technical experiences (how many times have you gone <em>back</em> to a bad restaurant?) so it should not be a surprise that we increasingly expect our apps to be worth it as well. And when considering how many apps are developed, it should not be at all surprising how many fail because they are either not providing the experience that the user expects or do not perform in a manner to benefit the business.</p>
<p>It is critically important for the developers to recognize not just how to put an application together but to ensure that the user can have a positive experience from it on top of the expected convenience. Frustration with those apps will only end up reflecting poorly on the application and those behind it. Even if it accomplishes what the users want, an unpleasant experience will negatively color the reviews and ultimately the product. But if we make things that not only do what they&#8217;re expected to do but make for a pleasant experience (or, at the very least, leave no lasting negative experience), then those apps will succeed in every way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple weeks you may have noticed that LessThanDot was completely down. I know we did. We&#8217;re working on solutions to our missing DR plan and shoring up some holes we found in our infrastructure (we had backups, they were just a little, er, stale).</p>
<p>Cue jokes about how a group with professional developers, architects, project managers, managers, consultants, etc didn&#8217;t have a DR plan.</p>
<p>Rest assured, this site means a lot to us (the founders), us (the people who blog here), and us (the people who get information or look up resources here). Along with updates to the &#8220;holy crap where did the site go&#8221; plan, this may be the jab we need to get back to some other feature-y changes we had lost steam on.</p>
<p>During the outage, I kept a temporary Azure website up with some information about the outage and a link to the monitoring (that I finally implemented an hour into the outage, oh well). We&#8217;ll have additional details and reactions posted in the blogs about the outage in the near future, but here is the content of that post for those that had not yet had a chance to see it:</p>
<hr />
<p> Thursday evening (my time), twitter messages started flowing in from LTD&#8217;ers who couldn&#8217;t access the site. </p>
<div style="text-align:  center; color:  #666666;">
            <img src="http://lessthandot.azurewebsites.net/images/tweets.png" alt="Twitter: Who ate our server?" title="Twitter: Who ate our server?" style="max-width: 600px;" /><br />
            Indeed.
        </div>
<h2>DDOS?</h2>
<p>        Our host, <a href="http://host4geeks.com/">host4geek</a> responded 4-5 hours into the incident to let us know a DDOS was occurring against the facility our server was in (which would not be covered by the <a href="https://host4geeks.com/tos/">SLA</a>). I added the site monitoring I had always intended to add but<br />
        never got around to. That way I&#8217;d get an alert when it came back up (or a measurement if it did not). </p>
<div style="text-align:  center; color:  #666666;">
            <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/0nt3y09cs5iy/935183"><img src="https://share.pingdom.com/banners/4931d952" alt="Uptime Report for http://lessthandot.com:/ Last 30 days" title="Uptime Report for http://lessthandot.com:/ Last 30 days" width="300" height="165" style="max-width:  300px" /></a><br />
            Click image for the full status page
        </div>
<p>Thank you <a href="http://pingdom.com/">pingdom</a> for a slick and easy setup process. The stats will look funky since I set this up an hour or two into the outage, so there&#8217;s no successful uptime recorded earlier in the month.</p>
<h2>Where&#8217;s the Server?</h2>
<p>
        Late Friday afternoon we received an update from Host4Geeks. Apparently they have a provider for the facitility and that provider had been planning a facility move. The provider had scheduled server migrations and then apparently Thursday night decided to just load up the remaining servers on a truck and take them to a third facility. or something. From<br />
        what I can tell this doesn&#8217;t fall under natural disasters, DDOS attacks, or planned maintenance, so we&#8217;ll also be working on getting credits for the service outage.
        </p>
<h2>So&#8230;ETA?</h2>
<p>
        So where is our server? I&#8217;m not entirely sure. We have not been given an ETA on when we can expect to be back online. Obviously this sucks for you, because you were probably trying to get to some very useful content. It sucks for us because we&#8217;d like to write some more really useful content. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll be working on some more content for everyone, considering our hosting options, and we&#8217;ll update this page as we have more information.
        </p>
<h2>Updated, Server Still MIA, 2013-08-27 9:45PM EDT (28th 1:45AM UTC)</h2>
<p>
        Good news, our host has informed us they recovered some of their servers! Well, not our server, but woohoo! Er&#8230;yeah. We have now been down for over 120 hours. We will be back, it&#8217;s just a question of whether they find our server before they have to offer us free hosting for life or not. We&#8217;ve also been discussing better disaster recovery plans (it&#8217;s a good thing none of us do that for a living, oh wait&#8230;), so on a positive note once we get through this outage we&#8217;ll be in a better place. And how often can you tell people your server is down because it was migrated to a truck in a dark parking lot somewhere&#8230;
        </p>
<h2 id="updated">Updated, No SLA, No ETA, 2013-09-03</h2>
<p>
        After prodding them again, our &#8216;host&#8217; has admitted they have no ETA on getting the remaining servers (ours included). We have also noticed that dedicated servers are specifically excluded from the SLA, so in essence the policy of our host is &#8220;downtime? sucks to be you&#8221;. We also found out that we forgot to finish setting up backups when we set up the server with them, so our most recent backup is March. They have told us our options are to setup a new server from our backups or &#8220;wait indefinitely&#8221; for our server to be located and brought online.
        </p>
<p>
        We will likely have to go the new server setup route, the next question we will have to consider is whether to do it with this host (who is paid through the end of the year), or find another and raise funds early for another year.
        </p>
<hr />
<p>Luckily as we were building out the new server, the old one finally came back online. More to come soon (including back to our regularly scheduled outpouring of technical blog goodness).</p>
