		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/datamgmt/dbadmin/oracleadmin/if-you-think-uninstalling-sql/"><![CDATA[<p>Because of a job change next week I have no need for Oracle anymore, I decided to remove it. I know that some people complain that uninstalling SQL Server is a pain, well those people should just be quiet from now on, uninstalling Oracle is much worse.</p>
<p>In order to uninstall Oracle, you need to run the Oracle Universal Installer. Once you run it, click on the Deinstall Products button</p>
<p>Now you will see something like this</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleRemove.PNG?mtime=1372946999"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleRemove.PNG?mtime=1372946999" width="438" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>
Click on the Oracle Home that you want to remove and then click on the Remove (not named uninstall or deinstall this time) button. Now you would expect that you would see another window where you could perhaps pick what to remove. But no, you get a dialog box telling you to go ahead and run a BAT file in a certain directory.  <br />
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleRemoveBatfile.PNG?mtime=1372947010"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleRemoveBatfile.PNG?mtime=1372947010" width="440" height="144" /></a></p>
<p>Really, you couldn&#8217;t at least have an option to run that file from withing this deinstaller?</p>
<p>Opening that BAT file reveals the following</p>

<p>When I posted that I was uninstalling Oracle, I got a reply from Tim Ford &#8221; Its easier to just rebuild the server.&#8221;  Maybe he is right??</p>
<p>Here is also a link to someone&#8217;s post about a last resort method http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/misc/manual-oracle-uninstall.php</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/yeah-i-am-sure-that/"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. today announced a partnership that will enable customers to run Oracle software on Windows Server Hyper-V and in Windows Azure. Customers will be able to deploy Oracle software — including Java, Oracle Database and Oracle WebLogic Server — on Windows Server Hyper-V or in Windows Azure and receive full support from Oracle</p>
<p>You can read the rest of the press release here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2013/Jun13/06-24WSNewsPR.aspx</p>
<p>Zdnet also reported this today here: http://www.zdnet.com/oracle-databases-head-to-microsofts-hyper-v-azure-7000017226/?s_cid=e589&amp;ttag=e589</p>
<p>Here is what I found interesting in that article, the following quote from Holger Mueller</p>
<blockquote><p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, said <strong>Microsoft is addressing the shortfall of its SQL Server in terms of scalability</strong>. Mueller added that the partnership, which doesn&#8217;t mention Oracle 12c directly, is larger than expected with the additions of WebLogic and Java.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really that is the reason, Microsoft allows running of Oracle on Azure because SQL Server has a scalibility problem?  Fascinating!!  What is next, Microsoft offers PHP because C# sucks?</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/ADvent/UmmNo.PNG?mtime=1359677914"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/ADvent/UmmNo.PNG?mtime=1359677914" width="304" height="409" /></a></div>
<p>The more plausible reason is that since Microsoft is competing directly with Amazon in the cloud, it wants to offer the same things that Amazon offers.  Amazon offers Oracle as well as SQL Server.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I think</p>

I already blogged a couple of times about differences between SQl Server and Oracle, those post are the following<br />

<p>Today we are going to look at the difference between a unique index in Oracle and in SQL Server.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with SQL Server. First create this table and also this index</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>

</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">CREATE</span> <span class="kw1">TABLE</span> TestUnique <span class="br0">&#40;</span>Id <span class="kw1">int</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>

<span class="kw1">CREATE</span> <span class="kw1">UNIQUE</span> <span class="kw1">INDEX</span> SomeIndex <span class="kw1">ON</span> TESTUNIQUE <span class="br0">&#40;</span>ID<span class="br0">&#41;</span>;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">CREATE TABLE TestUnique (Id int)


CREATE UNIQUE INDEX SomeIndex ON TESTUNIQUE (ID);</pre></div></div>

<p>Insert the following two rows</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">INSERT</span> <span class="kw1">INTO</span> TestUnique <span class="kw1">VALUES</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="nu0">1</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>;

<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">INSERT INTO TestUnique VALUES(1);
INSERT INTO TestUnique VALUES(null);</pre></div></div>

<p>Now let&#8217;s insert one more NULL</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">INSERT</span> <span class="kw1">INTO</span> TestUnique <span class="kw1">VALUES</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span>null<span class="br0">&#41;</span>;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">INSERT INTO TestUnique VALUES(null);</pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the error<br />
<em>Msg 2601, Level 14, State 1, Line 1<br />

The statement has been terminated.</null></em></p>
<p>As you can see you can only have one NULL value in the table</p>
<p>What about Oracle? Let&#8217;s take a look. Run this whole block, it will create a table, a unique index and will insert the same data<br />
</p>
<pre>CREATE TABLE TestUnique (Id int);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX INDEX1 ON TESTUNIQUE (ID);

INSERT INTO TestUnique VALUES(1);
INSERT INTO TestUnique VALUES(null);
INSERT INTO TestUnique VALUES(null);

SELECT * FROM TestUnique;</pre>
<p>Here is what it looks like from SQL developer</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleSQLOutput.PNG?mtime=1363737088"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleSQLOutput.PNG?mtime=1363737088" width="379" height="377" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see SQL Server only allows one NULL value while Oracle allows multiple NULL values. You have to be aware of these differences otherwise you might get unintended behavior from your programs</p>
<p>If you try to insert the value 1 again, you will get the following error</p>
<p>Error report:</p>
<pre>SQL Error: ORA-00001: unique constraint (SYSTEM.INDEX1) violated
00001. 00000 -  "unique constraint (%s.%s) violated"
*Cause:    An UPDATE or INSERT statement attempted to insert a duplicate key.
           For Trusted Oracle configured in DBMS MAC mode, you may see
           this message if a duplicate entry exists at a different level.
*Action:   Either remove the unique restriction or do not insert the key.</pre>
<p>Come back tomorrow to see how you can create an index in SQL Server that will allow multiple NULL values.

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/mssqlserver/ole-db-source-date-literal/"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I was developing an SSIS package in BIDS 2008R2 which was part of a Oracle to SQL Server migration; my favorite kind of migration. This package had a very simple SQL select statement in the OLE DB source using the Oracle OLE DB provider (slightly altered to protect the innocent):</p>
<pre>SELECT
	 columnA
	,columnB
	,42 AS Code
	,DATE'1900-01-01'
FROM user.myTable mt
WHERE mt.Status IN (10,20,30) AND mt.TransactionDate &gt; DATE'2012-01-01';</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The preview in the OLE DB worked flawlessly and I finished constructing my data flow. However, when I ran the package, I got all sorts of weird metadata errors indicating problems at the source. Basically the errors told me new columns needed to be added to the external columns collection (see the advanced editor of the source and check out the <em>Input and Output properties</em> tab) and that existing columns should be removed. Weird because the source and the SQL query hadn’t changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time to investigate the issue. To reproduce the issue, I created a very simple package with one data flow. In the data flow, I have this select statement in an OLE DB source retrieving data from the Oracle database:</p>
<pre>SELECT
	 DATE'2013-01-14' AS TestDate
	,'This is a test' AS TestString
	,42 AS TestInt
FROM DUAL;</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The output of the source component is connected to a multicast component, which serves as a trash destination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see in the following screenshot, the preview works without a hitch:</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/sourceconnection.PNG?mtime=1358753514"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/sourceconnection.PNG?mtime=1358753514" alt="" width="556" height="307" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">However, when I run the package, I get the following warnings and errors during validation:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">SSIS package &#8220;TestOracle.dtsx&#8221; starting. Information: 0x4004300A at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: Validation phase is beginning.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Warning: 0x800470C8 at (DFT) Read from Oracle, (OLE_SRC) Read from DUAL [1]: The external columns for component &#8220;(OLE_SRC) Read from DUAL&#8221; (1) are out of synchronization with the data source columns. The <strong>column &#8220;TEST&#8221; needs to be added</strong> to the external columns.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">The <strong>external column &#8220;TESTDATE&#8221; (191) needs to be removed</strong> from the external columns.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Error: 0xC004706B at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: &#8220;component &#8220;(OLE_SRC) Read from DUAL&#8221; (1)&#8221; failed validation and returned validation status &#8220;VS_NEEDSNEWMETADATA&#8221;.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Error: 0xC004700C at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: One or more component failed validation.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Error: 0xC0024107 at (DFT) Read from Oracle: There were errors during task validation.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">SSIS package &#8221; TestOracle.dtsx &#8221; finished: Failure.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I marked the issues in bold. Apparently, SSIS insists there’s a new column called Test which isn’t included in the SQL statement but should be added to the metadata anyway. The TestDate column, which is real, should be removed. Somehow, SSIS interpretes the SQL statement wrong and truncates the column name TestDate to Test.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing the <em>DelayValidation</em> property of the data flow to True didn’t have much effect. The package starts running but crashes at the source component:</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/error_delayvalidation.PNG?mtime=1358753556"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/error_delayvalidation.PNG?mtime=1358753556" alt="" width="296" height="229" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The output has also slightly changed:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">SSIS package &#8221; TestOracle.dtsx &#8221; starting.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information: 0x4004300A at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: Validation phase is beginning.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">…<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information: 0x40043006 at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: Prepare for Execute phase is beginning.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information: 0x40043007 at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: Pre-Execute phase is beginning.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Error: 0xC0202005 at (DFT) Read from Oracle, (OLE_SRC) Read from DUAL [210]: <strong>Column &#8220;TESTSTRING&#8221; cannot be found at the datasource</strong>.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Error: 0xC004701A at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: component &#8220;(OLE_SRC) Read from DUAL&#8221; (210) failed the pre-execute phase and returned error code 0xC0202005.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information: 0x40043008 at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: Post Execute phase is beginning.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information: 0x40043009 at (DFT) Read from Oracle, SSIS.Pipeline: Cleanup phase is beginning.<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Task failed: (DFT) Read from Oracle<br /></span></em><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">SSIS package &#8221; TestOracle.dtsx &#8221; finished: Failure.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I highlighted the important issue in bold and I removed some warnings about my input columns not being used in the data flow. Now, SSIS complains about another column suddenly missing at the datasource. However, the dual table in Oracle hasn’t changed of course and the SQL statement is also still the same. It’s also remarkable the preview works every time, but the data flow still fails.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what’s causing the issue? After playing around with the original query, a colleague and I guessed it might had something to do with the date literals used in the query, because seemingly it affected columns around the column using the date literal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I used the ANSI date literal to specify a hard-coded date value. For example: DATE’1900-01-01’. Check out the following Oracle documentation about date literals: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements003.htm#BABGIGCJ">Literals</a>. Let’s replace this literal with the Oracle date value TO_DATE(‘1900-01-01’,’yyyy-mm-dd’):</p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/OracleDateValue_query.PNG?mtime=1358753584"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/OracleDateValue_query.PNG?mtime=1358753584" alt="" width="397" height="283" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly, the package  runs without any problem:</span></p>
<div class="image_block" style="text-align: center;"><a href="/media/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/success.PNG?mtime=1358753621"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/Oracle_DateLiteral/success.PNG?mtime=1358753621" alt="" width="295" height="230" /></a></div>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">What’s more intriguing is that when I use the </span><em>Microsoft OLE DB provider for Oracle</em><span style="text-align: justify;"> using the original query, the package also runs succesfully. So it seems the Oracle OLE DB provider, downloaded from the Oracle website, has some sort of issue with the ANSI date literal. I haven’t found any documentation why the provider messes up the columns like that, but if someone has better Google skills, please drop a note in the comments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid using the ANSI date literals in your Oracle queries, but rather use the TO_DATE function. If it is an option, use the Microsoft OLE DB provider for Oracle.</p>

Here is some code that shows that.</p>
<p>First create this very simple table</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">CREATE</span> <span class="kw1">TABLE</span> dbo.<span class="me1">TruncateTest</span> <span class="br0">&#40;</span>ID <span class="kw1">int</span> <span class="kw1">IDENTITY</span> <span class="kw1">PRIMARY</span> <span class="kw1">KEY</span>,

<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">CREATE TABLE dbo.TruncateTest (ID int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, 
				SomeOtherCol varchar(49))
GO</pre></div></div>

<p>Add the following two rows</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1

<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">INSERT dbo.TruncateTest VALUES(1)
INSERT dbo.TruncateTest VALUES(1)</pre></div></div>

<p>Now execute this whole block in one shot, you will see three resultsets, two of them will have two rows and one resultset will be empty</p>

    SELECT * FROM dbo.TruncateTest -- 0 rows
ROLLBACK TRAN
 
SELECT * FROM dbo.TruncateTest  -- 2 rows again after rollback</pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the output</p>
<pre>ID          SomeOtherCol

<p>As you can see the table was empty at one point, however the table has the same two rows again, if you execute this query, you will see those two row again</p>

<h2>What about Oracle, can you rollback a truncate statement?</h2>
<p>In SQL Server the minimum permission required is ALTER on table_name. TRUNCATE TABLE permissions default to the table owner, members of the sysadmin fixed server role, and the db_owner and db_ddladmin fixed database roles, I blogged about this as well in the post <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/MSSQLServer/why-do-you-need-additional">Why do you need additional privileges for truncate table compared to delete?</a> </p>
<p>In Oracle to truncate a table, the table must be in your schema or you must have DROP ANY TABLE system privilege.</p>
<p>In Oracle a truncate statement is actually a DDL statement, you CANNOT rollback a truncate after it has happened. A truncate statement removes all rows  and returns the freed space to the tablespace containing the table.</p>
<p>Please keep these differences in mind when working with different platforms, don&#8217;t assume anything, it will bite you in the butt, always reference the documentation. For some more Oracle and SQL Server differences, see also my post <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/Oracle/differences-between-oracle-and-sql">Differences between Oracle and SQL Server when working with NULL and blank values</a></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/datamgmt/dbadmin/mssqlserveradmin/what-is-the-dual-table/"><![CDATA[<p>When coming from SQL Server, you might find it weird that you don&#8217;t see code that looks like this in Oracle&#8217;s PL/SQL</p>
<pre>select 2

select sysdate --  getdate()in SQL Server</pre>
<p>Unlike with SQL Server that code won&#8217;t run in Oracle, Oracle requires the use of the FROM clause in its syntax. This is why Oracle has the DUAL table.</p>
<p>If you try to run something like this</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">select</span> <span class="nu0">2</span>;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">select 2;</pre></div></div>

<p>you will get the following error</p>
<p><em>ORA-00923: FROM keyword not found where expected<br />
00923. 00000 &#8211;  &#8220;FROM keyword not found where expected&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I decided to see where the Dual table came from.</p>
<p>From wikipedia</p>
<blockquote><p>The DUAL table was created by Charles Weiss of Oracle corporation to provide a table for joining in internal views:</p>
<p>I created the DUAL table as an underlying object in the Oracle Data Dictionary. It was never meant to be seen itself, but instead used inside a view that was expected to be queried. The idea was that you could do a JOIN to the DUAL table and create two rows in the result for every one row in your table. Then, by using GROUP BY, the resulting join could be summarized to show the amount of storage for the DATA extent and for the INDEX extent(s). The name, DUAL, seemed apt for the process of creating a pair of rows from just one.</p>
<p>The original DUAL table had two rows in it (hence its name), but subsequently it only had one row.</p></blockquote>
<p>Running the following code</p>
<pre>select * from dual;</pre>
<p>Give you a resultset of 1 row with 1 column named DUMMY with the value X</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleDual.PNG?mtime=1357485931"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/Oracle/OracleDual.PNG?mtime=1357485931" width="315" height="74" /></a></p>
<p>So there you have it, this is why the Dual table exists.</p>
<p>If you need to do something like this</p>

<div class="bwp-syntax-block clearfix">
<div class="bwp-syntax-toolbar"><div class="bwp-syntax-control"><a href="javascript:;" class="bwp-syntax-source-switch" title="View Source Code"></a></div></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-wrapper clearfix bwp-syntax-simple"><table class="tsql"><thead><tr><td colspan="2"  class="head">T-SQL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="li1"><td class="ln"><pre class="de1">1
</pre></td><td class="de1"><pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">SELECT</span> <span class="nu0">3</span><span class="sy0">/</span><span class="nu0">2</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<div class="bwp-syntax-source"><pre class="no-parse">SELECT 3/2</pre></div></div>

<p>in Oracle it needs to be </p>
<pre>SELECT 3/2 from dual;</pre>
<p>However Oracle returns 1.5 while SQL Server will return 1, SQL Server does integer math and Oracle does not. That is another difference you need to be aware of, this is more problematic when moving from Oracle SQL Server and then wondering where all the decimals went.</p>

<p>As you can see we inserted four rows, one row is null, one row is blank, one row has a space and one row has Bla.</p>

<p>Here is an image of the same results<br />

<p>See what happened, Oracle changed the blanks to NULLs. </p>
<p>We can easily test this theory, let&#8217;s create a table with a column that has a not null constraint</p>
<pre>create table TestNull2(Col2 varchar(100) not null);</pre>
<p>Now of course if you try to insert a NULL it will blow up</p>
<pre>insert into TestNull2 values(NULL);</pre>
<p>Here is the error<br />
<em>SQL Error: ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into (&#8220;SYSTEM&#8221;.&#8221;TESTNULL2&#8243;.&#8221;COL2&#8243;)<br />
01400. 00000 &#8211;  &#8220;cannot insert NULL into (%s)&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Inserting Bla works without a problem</p>
<pre>insert into TestNull2 values('Bla');</pre>
<p>What about a blank, what will happen now?</p>
<pre>insert into TestNull2 values('');</pre>
<p><em>SQL Error: ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into (&#8220;SYSTEM&#8221;.&#8221;TESTNULL2&#8243;.&#8221;COL2&#8243;)<br />
01400. 00000 &#8211;  &#8220;cannot insert NULL into (%s)&#8221;</em></p>
<p>As you can see the blank gets converted to a NULL and you get the same error. This is very different from SQL Server.</p>
<p>Will a space succeed?</p>
<pre>insert into TestNull2 values(' ');</pre>
<p>A space is no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Coalesce differences</strong><br />
Just be aware that coalesce won&#8217;t work the same either. Oracle doesn&#8217;t have isnull but it has the nvl function instead</p>
<p>Run the following two statements</p>
<pre>select nvl('','No') as a
from dual;</pre>
<pre>select coalesce('','No') as a
from dual;</pre>
<p>In both cases you are getting No back from the function, as you can see a blank is treated as null.</p>
<p>Be aware of these differences between Oracle and SQL Server, you could have some strange results back from queries if you assume it works the same</p>
<p>We will take a look at that strange table <em>dual </em>in another post</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My blog post is about something weird I encountered while I was converting some old Oracle code to T-SQL (I encounter all sorts of weird stuff in Oracle code, but let’s stay on topic). Amongst all the usual cursor-madness, I stumbled upon this query:</p>
<pre>SELECT mt1.Column1, mt2.Column2
FROM [dbo].[MyTable1] mt1, [dbo].[MyTable2] mt2
WHERE      mt1.[JoinColumn1] (+)= mt2.[JoinColumn1]
       AND mt1.[JoinColumn2] (+)= mt2.[JoinColumn2]</pre>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The original query was much longer and more complex, but I kept only the necessary parts. I recognised the old-style of writing joins, also known as ANSI-89 joins (read more about them in </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/aaron_bertrand/archive/2009/10/08/bad-habits-to-kick-using-old-style-joins.aspx">Bad habits to kick : using old-style JOINs</a><span style="text-align: justify;">). However, I never came across the type of join designated by a (+)=. Most likely this has something to do what my lack of experience with Oracle, which I am very proud of :). SQL Server didn’t recognise the syntax so it had to be either Oracle only, or something very outdated. I asked about this on Twitter and a few people came up with </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645922.aspx">compound operators</a><span style="text-align: justify;"> which were introduced in SQL Server 2008, but luckily Mladen Prajdic (</span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/default.aspx">blog</a><span style="text-align: justify;"> | </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://twitter.com/MladenPrajdic">twitter</a><span style="text-align: justify;">) vaguely remembered those could be LEFT OUTER JOINs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><em>* UPDATE:  Apparently this syntax coresponds with RIGHT OUTER JOIN. For more info, see Robs comment below *</em></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">And he was right. After some Googling I found this Oracle doc page: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/queries006.htm">Joins</a>. It is described as the “Oracle join operator”. They advise not to use it, but you know, stuff like this always pops up in legacy code.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, if you’re converting some old Oracle code (we have to get rid of it once, don’t we?), now you know how to deal with this monstrosity.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>As you may or may not know I&#8217;m an avid SQL fan.<br />
I&#8217;m in the process of writing my 400th blogpost on lessthandot and I thought I would make it a little special and ask some special people about their experience with SQL. Just a few lines, why you like it or why you don&#8217;t like it. Perhaps an anecdote about it. A bad memory, a good memory. Just a few lines or just one line would make me happy. But if you don&#8217;t want to I will understand also. By SQL I could be about Access, Oracle SQL Server, DB2, NoSQL whatever comes to mind<br />
I will be asking this question to a bunch of  people. If you don&#8217;t mind include your twitter handle and blog URL so that I can add those</p></blockquote>
<p>I got a bunch of replies, here they are in the order that I received them. Feel free to add your own by leaving a comment</p>

<p>I fell in love with programming when doing some Excel VBA, from Excel I went to Access and I wrote some very cool programs in that, just until it became to slow for my needs. And then I switched to SQL-server. I started with SQL-server 2000 and I didn&#8217;t even have a clue how to install it. I started learning and finding out I did it all wrong. SQL is not what I do best but I learned a lot, due in a big part because of the wonderful SQL-community and my friends at Lessthandot.</p>

I was messing around with Access for quite a while before I started typing up the SQL for myself. It opened a whole new, quite addictive world for me.  Looking for SQL questions on the forums became a morning habit. A good SQL problem has all the fun of a puzzle with the added kick that it may be helpful. I suspect I will have to move up a level to maintain that kick.<br />

SQL Server has been the most predictable, reliable thing in my career, and when it&#8217;s been unpredictable or unreliable, the SQL Server community has been the most predictably, reliably helpful thing around.  Even when SQL is broke, the SQL community makes it a joy.</p>

To me, databases are the thing that justify the Pure Maths that I<br />
studied at university, and show me that computing isn&#8217;t just about<br />
either being a sysadmin or a programmer. I wish I had discovered that<br />
databases could be a career earlier than I did. Whether ANSI SQL,<br />
PL/SQL or T-SQL, those three letters are special to me.</p>

I started using Microsoft SQL Server approximately 10 years ago.  As a software vendor, it is the perfect solution because I can distribute SQL Express with my application for free.  If the customer already has (or chooses to buy) a paid for version of SQL Server, they can.  SQL Server allows me a lot of flexibility while still being able to offer a scalable solution to my customers.</p>

Since SQL is my life this is a rough question.  You&#8217;d think that would<br />
be the opposite and I could come up with a gazillion things that SQL<br />
(Server) has or did for me.  In reality, the one thing it did was<br />
provide me with the means to make a living doing what I love to do, it<br />
provides for my family, brings me close to friends like yourself and<br />
all around as introduced me to some of the most intelligent people on<br />
the face of the earth.</p>
<p>SQL Server isn&#8217;t easy nor hard to adapt it to any situation.  This<br />
makes it a viable area for anyone to succeed in.  As a complete<br />
solution revolving around data in general, SQL Server provides (me)<br />
and others the ability to have a continuing learning experience<br />
through the many features, internals and areas of processing it<br />
brings.  What would or could we ask for more?  It provides an enriched<br />
career full knowledge and experiences none would turn down.</p>

I discovered SQL as a language back in the Foxpro days, performing maintenance on a DOS application. I was amazed and surprised at the power of the language, coming from flat file databases. It just made sense to me, and it turned my career in the direction of SQL when I realized how simple and powerful SQL could be.</p>

Way back in the 1980’s, I was studying all of the currently available database systems and data-centric programming languages.  Email was still at least 7 years away and the Internet was 10 years to come.  To be honest, they were not at all intuitive or sensible.  But a new database model was emerging, the relational database.  Database normalization and design just ‘clicked’ for me.  It simply made sense.  And on top of the much easier design methods, the language that came along with the relational database, SQL, also made sense – a lot of sense.  I’d worked with Fortran, COBOL, and dBase quite a lot by that time.  But none of those programming languages could come close to the ease and simplicity of a SELECT statement. Hey, what could be easier than asking for the columns of data you wanted FROM a specific table WHERE it met a specific set of conditions?  It was exhilarating and powerful!  I’ve been stuck on SQL ever since and, while many other technologies have come and gone, I believe that I’ll be able to finish my career still working with and enjoying SQL.</p>

For me, SQL is the perfect blend of programming and simplicity. The internals of any relational engine are complex, and the cost based optimizer is order of magnitudes more complex than almost any code the normal programmer will be involved with. My personal interest lies in design, because the cost based optimizer is greatly affected by how well our design maps to the relational engine&#8217;s needs. The better the base design, the more likely the code you write will just work. It is really funny how easy design turns out to be, with the biggest obstacle often being your own mind. A great database design looks more complex than a poor one often does, usually because a poor design looks like how a procedural programmer would create a solution, rather than adjusting the design to match the needs of the code that will do the lion&#8217;s share of the work, the query processor. </p>

I do have a fun story about SQL.</p>
<p>One of my coworkers thinks she&#8217;s awesome: she deserves to be paid at the senior analyst level, is always on top of everything, is very competent and all. Well, the reality is actually a bit different (in the minds of me and several other coworkers). I mean, she is intelligent and does a good job, she isn&#8217;t a plodder or anything, but we can all tell you stories. Such as the less than efficient ways she runs things or how she acts like everyone else is irresponsible and she is perfect, but in fact SHE didn&#8217;t send us the email she&#8217;s grilling us about not replying to, or when the attention turns to what she didn&#8217;t do then woah suddenly we&#8217;re moving on to the next business item. Or she tells us that such-and-such she does can&#8217;t be automated and years later the issue gets attention and someone automates it in one day (laugh). Anyway, I had a wonderful little experience with her and SQL a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>So basically, her job is to be an application super-super-user. A glorified babysitter. Keep it running. Help plan and perform upgrades. Set up users and printers and workstations. Change the login message. And so on. But no development or use of highly technical computer skills. Except, she took a class in SQL once, and fancied herself capable in it. So one day she came to get me to ask for help with a SQL statement she was running. She said another coworker had sent it to her but it wasn&#8217;t working.</p>
<p>I kindly came to take a look and what she was trying to run in Query Analyzer (SQL 2000 days) was something like the following. I wish I could remember it exactly, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter because you&#8217;ll get the picture pretty quickly. Remember, this was sent to her by her coworker and she just copied and pasted and ran it as a SQL query:</p>
<pre>Set the users to disabled before the services are taken down</pre>
<p>Inside I laughed my head off while outside I calmly explained, to her great confusion, that it wasn&#8217;t a SQL statement, it was just plain English.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m glad to say that to this day she only runs whole SQL query files supplied as part of a predefined procedure that she has specifically been instructed to run.</p>
<p>Three cheers for &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a class in SQL&#8221; woman!</p>

In 2000 I’ve been on a project involving Oracle. That was when I decided to stay away from databases. In 2003 I’ve been doing some .Net work (no db’s remember  ) and had to pivot some results in SQL Server.<br />
This led me to SqlTeam.com forums where i looked up the solution, used it and it worked. But I stayed on SqlTeam because people were nice.<br />
Those online acquaintances have grown into friendships and I started answering questions. That has grown into a full blown addiction so I started blogging in 2004.<br />
Next logical step was to start speaking about SQL Server and learning about it.<br />
I was always more of a dev guy with only doing DBA work the last year or two.<br />
It’s not really about the product but about the people I meet in the process.<br />
Learning a product is always relatively easy. Meeting people too.<br />
But meeting cool people isn’t.</p>

My favorite SQL Server memory is probably taking a series of DTS packages in SQL 2000 that had several manual steps in the middle.  Using a series of script tasks, I was able to fully automate the process and save a few days a month of person-time.  I think this was probably the time that I fell in love with programming.</p>
<p>I also remember you, George and Ted showing me the right way to do things very early in my career.  I think this has given me a leg up on most developers when it comes time to work with the database.</p>

My first encounter with SQL Server was the same as many newbies have several years ago.</p>
<p>I do still remember the idiotic questions I asked, including the RAISERROR syntax question (which I should have learned from BOL instead) or why I was not seeing the output of PRINT command (the variable was NULL, doh!). These days are still vivid in memory and a conversation by phone with a former friend who stirred me on the right path when I wanted to duplicate Visual FoxPro functionality and create a separate database for each state.</p>
<p>I then started to use SQL Server professionally (as a developer) and the more I used it, the more I started to participate in different online forums and answer T-SQL related questions. At first it was ASP.NET  forum (where I started by asking many ASP,NET related questions but then ended up answering many simple questions in SQL related category). There I met George Mastros and was lately introduced to LTD site. I am very glad I am now able to blog on this site.<br />
I also started to learn more and more about SQL Server, read many SQL Server blogs, meet and become virtual friends with many of SQL Server professionals. So, now I&#8217;d say one of my life passions is in solving T-SQL problems and helping people with SQL Server related questions, even though there is a lot for me to learn about SQL Server and I continue to learn something new daily.</p>

In college, I had to take an Introduction to SQL class. We wrote basic SQL statements using a database on a mainframe. I was hooked. I finished the class in the first nine weeks, and spent the next nine weeks helping other students and getting more-advanced assignments from the instructor. I was in love, and I still am.</p>

I started as an application developer and my back-end was Access. However, once I learned how to actually write SQL code, I could not go back to the GUI of Access and prefer it even to some of the front-end development that I still have to do sometimes. There is something that is intrinsically more “real” to me with SQL and data than other aspects of development. After all, at the end of the day, the data is still the primary factor behind almost all development and the ability to work well with it is important – at least to me. And I would be remiss if I didn’t point out the great help that my friends at LessThanDot have offered that allowed me to learn what I have.</p>

My first foray into SQL Server I was fresh from MySQL and MS Access and couldn&#8217;t see past the first couple layers of tables and queries. Fast forward a few years and I was working with procedures and views and just starting to understand indexing. A few more years and I was working with SSRS and learning a lot more about tuning and topics like SARGability. SSAS, SSIS, the power of system views, backup and restore strategies, monitoring, &#8230;  The deeper and further I go, the more there is to learn, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be ending any time soon.</p>
<p>Funny anecdote/story: I was once performing destructive maintenance on a server (detaching and removing old databases) as well as rearranging data files for some active databases. I cleaned up all the stale Dbs and finished moving them from the old location to the new one with time to spare in my outage window. About an hour afterwards I received a phone call from the shipping office, who had tried all the normal troubleshooting steps (reboot, reboot again, etc) to figure out why their MS Access app was having problems. Halfway through walking them through checking their ethernet outlet, while literally saying something like &#8220;wiggle the cable and then try again&#8221;, I realized that there was one obscure database that a single form in their app relied on. I quickly reattached the forgotten DB just in time for them to connect properly. The rest of my time with the company the shipping office always wiggled their ethernet cable before calling me, and I haven&#8217;t forgotten to reattach a database since. Sometimes it&#8217;s the lessons from when we screw up that stick with us the longest.</p>
