Let&#8217;s say you have DROP and DROP TABLE in your list.</p>

<p>That infected millions of pages in 2008, there are still variants of this one today. A blacklist won&#8217;t help you in this case.</p>
<p>You can also protect yourself against this attack by denying SELECT permissions on the sysobjects table, your website user should not have access to these tables in general. If you use stored procedures you can just give access to the stored procedures and nothing else.</p>
<p>Every web framework today offers a way to use parameterized queries and or stored procedures. There is really no excuse to fall victim to a SQL injection attack these days. </p>
<p>Even using an ORM like Hibernate or Entity Framework is protected against SQL Injection because it use sp_executesql with proper parameters behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you do use stored procedures, you might still have a problem if you are using dynamic SQL inside the proc with EXEC and concatenation instead of sp_executesql with proper parameters</p>
<p>So why do people start out by using code that is prone to SQL injection? I think there are two parts to this. </p>
<ol>
<li>It is easier to debug and see what is contained in the string by doing a debug.write/response.write now you can see exactly what is being sent to the DB</li>
<li>There are still books/online examples around that show code that concatenate user input with SQL</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever I see code like this when a person asks for help, I immediately tell that person his code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack, it is my duty to alert this person, it is yours too, we need to educate these people</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/mysql-myisam-and-innodb-engine/"><![CDATA[<p>I am a stranger in a strange land. I am a SQL Server DBA and developer wandering, lost, in the world of MySQL. Fundamentally, I know that a database is a database. Both MySQL and SQL Server are built on the same ANSI standards. However, as I started working with the MySQL databases of a couple websites, I ran into unexpected limitations in MySQL. </p>
<p>SQL Server has one database engine. </p>
<p>MySQL has, as of version 5.6, ten. Ten database engines. Each with different features. In-depth information about each can be found at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/storage-engines.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/storage-engines.html</a>. </p>
<p>The one primarily being used in the databases I&#8217;ve been working with is <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/myisam-storage-engine.html">MyISAM</a>. It&#8217;s a fast engine, designed for databases with a lot of read activity. The drawback to this, for me, is that it lacks both support for foreign keys and transactions. </p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg/220px-The_Scream.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>I discovered this when I was looking in a database, at a table of resource articles. There was also a table of resource categories. I was trying to find the foreign key between the two tables. I even exported the structure out of phpMyAdmin, imported into <a href="http://www.quest.com/toad-for-mysql/">Toad for MySQL</a>, and created an ERD. There were no foreign keys in the database. After doing some research, I found out that MyISAM simply does not support foreign key constraints. </p>
<p>While writing some code for this database, I came to another realization: the MyISAM engine doesn&#8217;t support transactions. I can&#8217;t wrap a SQL statement in &#8220;BEGIN TRAN&#8230;COMMIT TRAN&#8221;. You can lock tables, however. </p>
<p>As of MySQL 5.5, the default engine type became <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-storage-engine.html">InnoDB</a>. This engine supports both foreign keys in tables and transactions. These tables also require more space on disk, and updates require more memory. So, there are trade-offs. </p>
<p>One other thing to note is that within a single database, tables can be of different engine types. If it makes sense for some of your tables to be formatted as MyISAM for speed and others to be InnoDB for transactional consistency, you can design the database this way. This flexibility is a really nice option. </p>
<p>Another lesson learned!</p>

<p>Here is how I asked it</p>
<blockquote><p>As you may or may not know I&#8217;m an avid SQL fan.<br />
I&#8217;m in the process of writing my 400th blogpost on lessthandot and I thought I would make it a little special and ask some special people about their experience with SQL. Just a few lines, why you like it or why you don&#8217;t like it. Perhaps an anecdote about it. A bad memory, a good memory. Just a few lines or just one line would make me happy. But if you don&#8217;t want to I will understand also. By SQL I could be about Access, Oracle SQL Server, DB2, NoSQL whatever comes to mind<br />
I will be asking this question to a bunch of  people. If you don&#8217;t mind include your twitter handle and blog URL so that I can add those</p></blockquote>
<p>I got a bunch of replies, here they are in the order that I received them. Feel free to add your own by leaving a comment</p>
<hr />
<p>I fell in love with programming when doing some Excel VBA, from Excel I went to Access and I wrote some very cool programs in that, just until it became to slow for my needs. And then I switched to SQL-server. I started with SQL-server 2000 and I didn&#8217;t even have a clue how to install it. I started learning and finding out I did it all wrong. SQL is not what I do best but I learned a lot, due in a big part because of the wonderful SQL-community and my friends at Lessthandot.</p>

I was messing around with Access for quite a while before I started typing up the SQL for myself. It opened a whole new, quite addictive world for me.  Looking for SQL questions on the forums became a morning habit. A good SQL problem has all the fun of a puzzle with the added kick that it may be helpful. I suspect I will have to move up a level to maintain that kick.<br />

SQL Server has been the most predictable, reliable thing in my career, and when it&#8217;s been unpredictable or unreliable, the SQL Server community has been the most predictably, reliably helpful thing around.  Even when SQL is broke, the SQL community makes it a joy.</p>

To me, databases are the thing that justify the Pure Maths that I<br />
studied at university, and show me that computing isn&#8217;t just about<br />
either being a sysadmin or a programmer. I wish I had discovered that<br />
databases could be a career earlier than I did. Whether ANSI SQL,<br />
PL/SQL or T-SQL, those three letters are special to me.</p>

I started using Microsoft SQL Server approximately 10 years ago.  As a software vendor, it is the perfect solution because I can distribute SQL Express with my application for free.  If the customer already has (or chooses to buy) a paid for version of SQL Server, they can.  SQL Server allows me a lot of flexibility while still being able to offer a scalable solution to my customers.</p>

Since SQL is my life this is a rough question.  You&#8217;d think that would<br />
be the opposite and I could come up with a gazillion things that SQL<br />
(Server) has or did for me.  In reality, the one thing it did was<br />
provide me with the means to make a living doing what I love to do, it<br />
provides for my family, brings me close to friends like yourself and<br />
all around as introduced me to some of the most intelligent people on<br />
the face of the earth.</p>
<p>SQL Server isn&#8217;t easy nor hard to adapt it to any situation.  This<br />
makes it a viable area for anyone to succeed in.  As a complete<br />
solution revolving around data in general, SQL Server provides (me)<br />
and others the ability to have a continuing learning experience<br />
through the many features, internals and areas of processing it<br />
brings.  What would or could we ask for more?  It provides an enriched<br />
career full knowledge and experiences none would turn down.</p>

I discovered SQL as a language back in the Foxpro days, performing maintenance on a DOS application. I was amazed and surprised at the power of the language, coming from flat file databases. It just made sense to me, and it turned my career in the direction of SQL when I realized how simple and powerful SQL could be.</p>

Way back in the 1980’s, I was studying all of the currently available database systems and data-centric programming languages.  Email was still at least 7 years away and the Internet was 10 years to come.  To be honest, they were not at all intuitive or sensible.  But a new database model was emerging, the relational database.  Database normalization and design just ‘clicked’ for me.  It simply made sense.  And on top of the much easier design methods, the language that came along with the relational database, SQL, also made sense – a lot of sense.  I’d worked with Fortran, COBOL, and dBase quite a lot by that time.  But none of those programming languages could come close to the ease and simplicity of a SELECT statement. Hey, what could be easier than asking for the columns of data you wanted FROM a specific table WHERE it met a specific set of conditions?  It was exhilarating and powerful!  I’ve been stuck on SQL ever since and, while many other technologies have come and gone, I believe that I’ll be able to finish my career still working with and enjoying SQL.</p>

For me, SQL is the perfect blend of programming and simplicity. The internals of any relational engine are complex, and the cost based optimizer is order of magnitudes more complex than almost any code the normal programmer will be involved with. My personal interest lies in design, because the cost based optimizer is greatly affected by how well our design maps to the relational engine&#8217;s needs. The better the base design, the more likely the code you write will just work. It is really funny how easy design turns out to be, with the biggest obstacle often being your own mind. A great database design looks more complex than a poor one often does, usually because a poor design looks like how a procedural programmer would create a solution, rather than adjusting the design to match the needs of the code that will do the lion&#8217;s share of the work, the query processor. </p>

I do have a fun story about SQL.</p>
<p>One of my coworkers thinks she&#8217;s awesome: she deserves to be paid at the senior analyst level, is always on top of everything, is very competent and all. Well, the reality is actually a bit different (in the minds of me and several other coworkers). I mean, she is intelligent and does a good job, she isn&#8217;t a plodder or anything, but we can all tell you stories. Such as the less than efficient ways she runs things or how she acts like everyone else is irresponsible and she is perfect, but in fact SHE didn&#8217;t send us the email she&#8217;s grilling us about not replying to, or when the attention turns to what she didn&#8217;t do then woah suddenly we&#8217;re moving on to the next business item. Or she tells us that such-and-such she does can&#8217;t be automated and years later the issue gets attention and someone automates it in one day (laugh). Anyway, I had a wonderful little experience with her and SQL a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>So basically, her job is to be an application super-super-user. A glorified babysitter. Keep it running. Help plan and perform upgrades. Set up users and printers and workstations. Change the login message. And so on. But no development or use of highly technical computer skills. Except, she took a class in SQL once, and fancied herself capable in it. So one day she came to get me to ask for help with a SQL statement she was running. She said another coworker had sent it to her but it wasn&#8217;t working.</p>
<p>I kindly came to take a look and what she was trying to run in Query Analyzer (SQL 2000 days) was something like the following. I wish I could remember it exactly, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter because you&#8217;ll get the picture pretty quickly. Remember, this was sent to her by her coworker and she just copied and pasted and ran it as a SQL query:</p>
<pre>Set the users to disabled before the services are taken down</pre>
<p>Inside I laughed my head off while outside I calmly explained, to her great confusion, that it wasn&#8217;t a SQL statement, it was just plain English.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m glad to say that to this day she only runs whole SQL query files supplied as part of a predefined procedure that she has specifically been instructed to run.</p>
<p>Three cheers for &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a class in SQL&#8221; woman!</p>

In 2000 I’ve been on a project involving Oracle. That was when I decided to stay away from databases. In 2003 I’ve been doing some .Net work (no db’s remember  ) and had to pivot some results in SQL Server.<br />
This led me to SqlTeam.com forums where i looked up the solution, used it and it worked. But I stayed on SqlTeam because people were nice.<br />
Those online acquaintances have grown into friendships and I started answering questions. That has grown into a full blown addiction so I started blogging in 2004.<br />
Next logical step was to start speaking about SQL Server and learning about it.<br />
I was always more of a dev guy with only doing DBA work the last year or two.<br />
It’s not really about the product but about the people I meet in the process.<br />
Learning a product is always relatively easy. Meeting people too.<br />
But meeting cool people isn’t.</p>

My favorite SQL Server memory is probably taking a series of DTS packages in SQL 2000 that had several manual steps in the middle.  Using a series of script tasks, I was able to fully automate the process and save a few days a month of person-time.  I think this was probably the time that I fell in love with programming.</p>
<p>I also remember you, George and Ted showing me the right way to do things very early in my career.  I think this has given me a leg up on most developers when it comes time to work with the database.</p>

My first encounter with SQL Server was the same as many newbies have several years ago.</p>
<p>I do still remember the idiotic questions I asked, including the RAISERROR syntax question (which I should have learned from BOL instead) or why I was not seeing the output of PRINT command (the variable was NULL, doh!). These days are still vivid in memory and a conversation by phone with a former friend who stirred me on the right path when I wanted to duplicate Visual FoxPro functionality and create a separate database for each state.</p>
<p>I then started to use SQL Server professionally (as a developer) and the more I used it, the more I started to participate in different online forums and answer T-SQL related questions. At first it was ASP.NET  forum (where I started by asking many ASP,NET related questions but then ended up answering many simple questions in SQL related category). There I met George Mastros and was lately introduced to LTD site. I am very glad I am now able to blog on this site.<br />
I also started to learn more and more about SQL Server, read many SQL Server blogs, meet and become virtual friends with many of SQL Server professionals. So, now I&#8217;d say one of my life passions is in solving T-SQL problems and helping people with SQL Server related questions, even though there is a lot for me to learn about SQL Server and I continue to learn something new daily.</p>

In college, I had to take an Introduction to SQL class. We wrote basic SQL statements using a database on a mainframe. I was hooked. I finished the class in the first nine weeks, and spent the next nine weeks helping other students and getting more-advanced assignments from the instructor. I was in love, and I still am.</p>

I started as an application developer and my back-end was Access. However, once I learned how to actually write SQL code, I could not go back to the GUI of Access and prefer it even to some of the front-end development that I still have to do sometimes. There is something that is intrinsically more “real” to me with SQL and data than other aspects of development. After all, at the end of the day, the data is still the primary factor behind almost all development and the ability to work well with it is important – at least to me. And I would be remiss if I didn’t point out the great help that my friends at LessThanDot have offered that allowed me to learn what I have.</p>

My first foray into SQL Server I was fresh from MySQL and MS Access and couldn&#8217;t see past the first couple layers of tables and queries. Fast forward a few years and I was working with procedures and views and just starting to understand indexing. A few more years and I was working with SSRS and learning a lot more about tuning and topics like SARGability. SSAS, SSIS, the power of system views, backup and restore strategies, monitoring, &#8230;  The deeper and further I go, the more there is to learn, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be ending any time soon.</p>
<p>Funny anecdote/story: I was once performing destructive maintenance on a server (detaching and removing old databases) as well as rearranging data files for some active databases. I cleaned up all the stale Dbs and finished moving them from the old location to the new one with time to spare in my outage window. About an hour afterwards I received a phone call from the shipping office, who had tried all the normal troubleshooting steps (reboot, reboot again, etc) to figure out why their MS Access app was having problems. Halfway through walking them through checking their ethernet outlet, while literally saying something like &#8220;wiggle the cable and then try again&#8221;, I realized that there was one obscure database that a single form in their app relied on. I quickly reattached the forgotten DB just in time for them to connect properly. The rest of my time with the company the shipping office always wiggled their ethernet cable before calling me, and I haven&#8217;t forgotten to reattach a database since. Sometimes it&#8217;s the lessons from when we screw up that stick with us the longest.</p>

<h2>Scheduled!</h2>
<p></span></p>
<p>
The SQL Saturday in Chicago team has been working pretty hard lately on the schedule.  It was difficult to complete due to all of the sessions being so good.  I was close to trying a two day event so we could get all ~70 submissions up the weekend of April 17th.   </p>
<p>You can now see the schedule up on the SQL Saturday site <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/31/schedule.aspx">here</a>
</p>
<p>
Of course we had to pick what the location we are using could handle and I think the team did an excellent job.  At last count we only have around 100 open spots left until we reach capacity so move quickly and get your registration in before the seats are taken.
</p>
<p><span class="MT_under"><br />
<h2>Questions not covered?</h2>
<p></span></p>
<p>
We will be holding an, “Ask the experts” session after the regular schedule also.  This means basically you bring your questions to all of us and we’ll do our best to answer them then and there.  If we can’t, we’ll twitter it and get an answer in a few minutes using #sqlhelp <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Jorge already tested that theory at the last SSUG he was attending.
</p>
<p><span class="MT_under"><br />
<h2>Sponsorship is how we do this</h2>
<p></span></p>
<p>
I would also like to take this time to thank each and every sponsor that is helping us with this event.  Combined with the speakers, volunteers and sponsorship, this event would not be possible.  Remember, this is a completely free event thanks to our most generous sponsors.</p>
<p>You can see the impressive list of sponsors <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/31/sponsors.aspx">here</a>
</p>
<p>
Each company has been great to work with and I’m looking forward to learning more about some of the products they have introduced me to while discussing SQL with them.<br />
We still have a few sponsors to get up on the site so check back regularly to see who will be active in the event as sponsors.  </p>
<p>The event is also being held in a hotel so if you are traveling, getting to your room and the sessions is easier than you may think.  Details on the location can be found <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/31/location.aspx">here</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<h1>I hope to see you all there!</h1>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/datamgmt/datadesign/introducing-sql-server-to-oracle/"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few weeks I have been working on the task of bringing an Oracle database into my SQL Server landscape.  The basic process that needs to be accomplished is to get this Oracle database pumped into the existing SQL Server structure primarily to address the reporting aspect and requirements.  The software that utilizes the Oracle database could easily sit in their own little world without much need for us to go outside that shell but given my completely SSRS reporting structure, there is a need to build off the new data store for the users taking into account the completely native SQL Server backend.</p>
<p>Oracle can easily bring itself into SSRS as a data source.  In fact I highly recommend only doing that if you find yourself with this task.  The company I currently work with however, require that the data be backed up, available in all sources and backed up again.  To resolve the businesses needs I chose to bring the entire Oracle database into a SQL Server database nightly so the data was readily available and easily accessed by the skills of my group.  In my experience as a SQL Server professional, when Oracle is introduced into a SQL Server environment, the last thing you want to do to your developers and Jr. DBAs is install the Oracle client on all their machines and then throw SQL*Plus at them.  There is a reason that it’s hard to find cross dressing Oracle/SQL Server Experts.  They mix like UNIX and Windows OS.</p>
<p>The major key that will adjust the process of how you obtain a complete extract from Oracle to SQL Server is the size of data and the network structure.  One thing you should think about prior to starting the actual setup of this type is what data do you really need?  In the case when there is a set based data result you can export in a 24 hour period by date, you can look at this process as a type of wannabe warehouse ETL process.  Use SQL Server as your holding tank in which you retain the critical data that is required to recover and supply the business with the data.  SQL Server Integrated Services is a tool that can quickly get you up and running on the type of export I’m outlining above.   With SSIS you can work with the Oracle design to bridge the data into a SQL Server design.  This gives you an upper hand over writing queries that may not be efficient in T-SQL to extract data for reporting by means of doing the conversion to the SQL Server design at export/import stages.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve laid down the plan, I want to make one hardened statement.  “Never install the Oracle client on a production database server that holds other databases that are critical to the company”.</p>
<p>You may be asking why I say that without much room for the maybe situations.  Here are the facts.  You are probably reading this because you are a SQL Server shop and have little to no Oracle experience or an Oracle DBA on hand.  In my experience, the Oracle client is not an easy task for SQL Server DBAs to plug in and get going.  I have done this 4 times in my career and still have a hard time with it.  There are basic steps involved to get Oracle working from remote servers.  Install the client, setup TNSNAMES and a few other minor requirements just to get a functioning SQL*Plus session.  On each installation those steps never went the same and were never direct for me.  The reasoning behind this is, we as SQL Server DBAs are not Oracle infrastructure experts.  Spending a day reading up on how the client and Oracle instance work together on Windows (possibly to UX) is not efficient to call anyone an expert on any process.  Don’t approach this task as if you are.  It has failure and hardships written all over it.  </p>
<p>If you have the resources and budget available, create a job server installation that can assist in making the implementation of the Oracle instance onto your SQL Server instances easier to manage and troubleshoot.  Job servers are something I push for in all environments for SQL Server.  There is performance factors that come to mind when putting major job tasks on production database server that have the task of serving data to the business.  It is an easy resolution to a growing or already large integration services group to move them off to an instance that is designated and configured to handle the different needs of SSIS and what you are doing with it.</p>
<p>So even with my poor diagramming abilities, you can see the safety barrier between the two different systems.  </p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt//job_diagram.gif" alt="" title="" width="540" height="480" /></div>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong on everything I’ve written either.  I am not an Oracle hatter.  Yes, I have chosen the SQL Server DBA path because it’s just that much better (:P).  I have worked on DB2, Oracle and SQL Server.  All have their strengths and all have weaknesses.  </p>
<p>When the time comes for you to think about making them all work together, I hope this short blog of a possible mix will help you get the gears going.  It’s critical in the process of integrating different database servers into your environment to ensure they do not affect the abilities of them working optimally.</p>

<p>SSMS Tools PACK is an Add-In (Add-On) for Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express, this tool is developed by <a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/">Mladen Prajdi&#263;</a>. </p>
<p>SSMS Tools PACK contains a few upgrades to the IDE that were missing from Management Studio:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Features.aspx#WCC" class="Titles">Window Connection Coloring.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Features.aspx#SSC" class="Titles">Query Execution History (Soft Source Control) and Current Window History.</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Features.aspx#NQT" class="Titles">New query template.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these features are now available in SSMS 2008 but the tool is still very useful if you are using SSMS 2008. I am going to focus on the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) stored procedure generation functionality.</p>
<p>SSMS Tools PACK is available for the following SSMS versions</p>
<p>SQL Server Management Studio 2008 <br /> <br />
SQL Server Management Studio 2008 Express<br /> <br />
SQL Server Management Studio 2005<br /> <br />
SQL Server Management Studio 2005 Express</p>
<p>Download SSMS Tools PACK here: <a href="http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Download.aspx">http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Download.aspx</a></p>
<p>After it is installed create this table</p>

<p>As you can see I added a comment block there that has my name and the initial version number. Having all your developers use a tool like this is great because you will have all the same looking procs and don&#8217;t have to worry that some people use @Error or @ErrorCode or @ErrorID. You just modify the template to have the error checking that you have standardized upon and you are done</p>
<p>So now let&#8217;s see what SSMS Tools PACK generates</p>
<p>Right click on the table you created, select SSMS Tools and then Create CRUD (See image below)</p>

I asked Kevin Kline if he would be interested in an interview and as you can see he said yes.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Is the book geared towards a beginner/intermediate level user or do you have to be an advanced user to really utilize the information in this book?</strong></p>
<p>KK> This book is more of an intermediate + book, since it is a syntax reference.  For example, the book assumes you know what command you want to look up and doesn&#8217;t spend a lot of time educating you as to which command you should use for a given business requirement, as is the case with most O&#8217;Reilly books from the &#8220;In a Nutshell&#8221; series.  For beginning SQL, I recommend &#8220;Learning SQL&#8221; also published by O&#8217;Reilly &amp; Associates.</p>
<p><strong>Denis:  What are the most important things a person can do to master SQL?</strong></p>
<p>KK> Practice!  You simply cannot expect to master SQL, or any programming language for that matter, without doing a lot of it.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: What part of SQL do people struggle the most with?</strong></p>
<p>KK> There are a couple areas that tend to be programmatic for those who are new to SQL.  But I&#8217;d say that the biggest area of struggle, far and away, is getting used to Set Theory.  Set theory governs how data is managed in large sets of records.  It&#8217;s the way that relational databases manipulate data, but most people especially those who&#8217;ve programmed in other popular languages are used to thinking about data one row at a time.  This lead to performance problems.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Between the second edition and the third edition of your book, from a pure SQL standpoint which RDBMS has added the most features?</strong></p>
<p>KK> If I&#8217;m measuring the most progress against the ANSI standard, I&#8217;d have to say that MySQL has added the most new SQL features.  On the other hand, MySQL started from a deficit, meaning that in early editions of my book, MySQL didn&#8217;t meet the ANSI standard for many commands and functions.  So just by complying with the ANSI standard in their latest release, they&#8217;ve added the most new features.  If I&#8217;m measuring by the most new features regardless of the ANSI standard, I&#8217;d have to say that Microsoft SQL Server has made the most progress with their many new data types and commands.  By comparison, Oracle tends to add new features via add-on products outside of the main relational engine which you must buy separately, while SQL Server adds them at no added charge right in the box.  An example of this might include the spatial data type, in the box with SQL Server, but a separate bolt-on with Oracle.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: From each RDBMS covered in your book can you name your favorite feature which is unique to that RDBMS?</strong></p>
<p>KK> I cover fewer database in the 3rd edition than in the 2nd edition since few readers expressed an interest in continuing coverage of IBM&#8217;s DB2 UDB or Sybase&#8217;s Adaptive Server.  Having said that, we still cover the ANSI standard plus the four most popular database &#8211; Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.  For Oracle, I love the incredibly powerful MODEL statement and the DECODE function.  They rock!  For SQL Server, I enjoy the PIVOT and UNPIVOT statements and its XML handling features.  MySQL has a very nifty capability of utilizing several different transaction processing engines, such as InnoDB and MyISAM, some of which focus on raw processing power by dispensing with the niceties.  And I really, really like PostgreSQL unwaivering support of the ANSI standard in all of their SQL statements.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Should people write pure ANSI SQL or are there times when it is okay to write proprietary SQL?</strong></p>
<p>KK> I&#8217;m a big believer in going for performance, and that means writing proprietary code.  Most internal IT shops should usually go with the proprietary code since the application will be for an internal customer who will run the application on only one database platform.  On the other hand, most ISV&#8217;s write their database applications for multiple database platforms to support the widest possible customer base and, invariably, these applications are always performance wastelands.  ANSI SQL is the place to get your fundamental schooling from, but in my opinion, it should not be the destination to take your application to.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Is there a large percentage of people who work with more than one RDBMS at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>KK> We&#8217;d seen a long time span from the late 1990&#8217;s til late in this decade where most database professionals focused on only one database.  However, something that has happened in the last two years is a major upsurge in corporate mergers and acquisitions.  As a result, many more people are being asked to take on a database platform outside of their comfort zone.  I&#8217;d say that the percentages have shifted from about 15% of multi-platform enterprise DBAs a few years ago to as much as 25% today.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: What SQL books are on your bookshelf?</strong></p>
<p>KK> I still keep a copy of SQL99: Complete &#8211; Really! as well as the ANSI 2006 SQL standard.  I have Celco&#8217;s SQL for Smarties, Feuerstein&#8217;s PL/SQL Programming, and Ben-Gan&#8217;s Inside Transact-SQL Programming and Inside Transact-SQL Queries.  In addition, I&#8217;ll always keep a copy of my late friend Ken Henderson&#8217;s The Guru&#8217;s Guide to Transact-SQL for sentimental reasons.  I also have general database books about all the database platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Why do you write technical books?</strong></p>
<p>KK> It started out with a bit of an ironic twist.  When I wrote my first book in the early 1990&#8217;s, I was planning on completing a master&#8217;s degree with a thesis.  I pitched the thesis abstract to a book publishing company and was surprised when the accepted it.  And the simple truth is that I always wanted to write and enjoy writing.  That&#8217;s why I still do it today.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Which chapter was the hardest to write and can you explain why?</strong></p>
<p>KK> There&#8217;s no doubt that the section of SQL in a Nutshell that covers ALTER, CREATE, and DROP statements was the most difficult.  And I fully blame Oracle for this.  Here&#8217;s an example derived from the vendor documentation.  The CREATE TABLE statement for MySQL and PostgreSQL runs to about 25 pages each.  The same statement has more variations on Microsoft SQL Server and so runs to about 55 pages in their documentation.  But on Oracle, the CREATE TABLE statement runs well over 160 pages with more variation, permutations, and sub-permutations than is imaginable.  No offense to the vendors here, but there is such a thing as overloading a statement or function with too much weight.  So you can imagine how much time and energy it took to distill these statements down to a digestable size!</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Who are your favorite authors?</strong></p>
<p>KK> In the database world, my two favorite authors are Kalen Delaney of Inside SQL Server fame and Steven Feuerstein, author of PL/SQL Programming and many other excellent Oracle books and a fine blog as well.  Outside of the database world, I&#8217;m a voracious reader on all topics, both fiction and non-fiction.  However, I will always read anything put out by two non-fiction writers &#8211; Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs and Steel, and Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore&#8217;s Delimma.</p>
<p><strong>Denis: Where can we expect to see you in 2009? Any conferences, seminars, trade shows or classrooms perhaps?</strong></p>
<p>KK> It&#8217;s no secret that the economy has taken a downturn.  So it&#8217;s almost a certainty that I&#8217;ll speak at fewer local user groups this year than in years past.  However, I&#8217;m sure to be at TechEd this May and at the PASS 2009 Summit in Seattle this fall.  I hope to see you there!</p>
