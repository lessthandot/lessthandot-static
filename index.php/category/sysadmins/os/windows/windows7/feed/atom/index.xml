		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/sysadmins/os/hi-i-m-a-developer/"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The world of development is an interesting one where creativity comes alive through code to produce wonderful programs that do lots of cool stuff.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Okay that&#8217;s the Wizard of Oz intro over, is it really that rosy?</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It seems the world of development has changed a great deal and gone are the days when you could just be a code cutter (though such roles do exist and are required), it seems a developer has to now master a wide array of skills and do battle with various foes like the Windows Operating System (<em>level 72 elite boss for those that are keeping track&#8230;</em>) as well trying to do their day job (<em>which in itself now consists of different minion roles</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">With the advances in .NET development there are a wide range of Frameworks, Tools and Add-Ons that can be worked with, installed and generally cried over (<em>a black hole in which I have been sucked into, the crying bit&#8230;</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/coders.jpg?mtime=1359936989" alt="Coders" width="282" height="202" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Now I can hear you say, that&#8217;s all good but we don&#8217;t have those problems, we have a <strong>Textbook Development Team</strong> with a <strong>Textbook It Support Team</strong> in a <strong>Textbook Office</strong> but that is not quite the real world and you will often have boundaries between teams becoming thinner or more common now, the lack of resources and/or teams (<em>leaving the task of taking on those roles and their responsibilities up to the individuals in the department and organisation</em>).</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But then the question has to be asked, just how efficient and proficient can you be as an individual, a team and a department if you are spending a percentage of your available resource and effort performing other duties, often to prepare something prior to performing your actual task or after the event where you still need to perform a multitude of other tasks (<em>covering various roles like administration etc.</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">And this is where my hell begins&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;">Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I enjoy the techie element of my role, I feel I fulfil the developer title more fully by being able to flex my many different skills (<em>making me adaptable for almost any occasion</em>), a result of accumulating experience in a wide range of sectors starting from my humble beginnings as an IT Support guy, moving into a System Administration role, sideways across into Application Support, Technical Project Lead, Solution Architecture and back into Software Development in my current role as an Senior .NET Enterprise Developer (</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><em>not Star Trek&#8230;I wish it was, but it&#8217;s not and I have to live with that disappointment for the rest of my career life&#8230;I tried do the Spock hand thing, got strange looks from the others in the developer forum&#8230;</em></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;">).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the company where I work now, my team is fairly self-sufficient and that often means we do a lot of the stuff ourselves (<em>whilst still going through proper channels as required</em>) which is great as it means we can quickly prototype solutions through a Virtual Machine on our PC or install a particular tool we need to perform some task &#8211; all of this means that we generally have control over our own PC&#8217;s (<em>as all developers should&#8230;but they don&#8217;t unfortunately</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But it&#8217;s a double edged sword as I found out the past few days and while being able to administer your own PC&#8217;s and Server&#8217;s is great it can quickly become a bottomless pit that you simply can&#8217;t escape no matter how many Bear Ghryll&#8217;s episodes you have watched (<em>some English guy on the TV that does cool stuff to survive, like James Bond for the wild</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So begins my particular episode&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I have a pretty snazzy developer PC inherited from my predecessor, a rather cool Hewlet Packard Z600 Workstation specced up to the hilt with serious &#8216;Uber&#8217; hardware (<em>dual quad Xeon&#8217;s, stupid amount of memory, SSD&#8217;s, drool&#8230;</em>) and thankfully I have complete control over it (<em>mostly</em>) so I had the chance to configure my PC the way I wanted it to do the development I needed to do.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I have the usual culprits on there, Visual Studio 2010 Premium SP1, MSSQL Server 2008 R2, VMware, lots of useful tools (<em>Notepad++, Red Gate, Solitaire</em>) all running on a Windows 7 Professional 64 bit&#8230;nothing out of the ordinary there I hear you say, ah I haven’t told you about that little evil gremlin called Oracle, more specifically Oracle 64 bit and 32 bit clients on a 64 bit operating system (<em>yes, that combination should cause you to feel nauseous</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The goal was simple, get the latest version of a large .NET Enterprise project, build it, tweak it, break it and glue it back together.  However there was one caveat, I needed to then install the following in some order (<em>mostly like this one</em>):</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Install the Oracle 64 bit Client for Windows</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Install the 64 bit ODAC stuff (<em>for some nice ODACness</em>), the Xcopy version btw</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Install the 32 bit Client (ODT with ODAC)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Simple enough I thought, having virtual zero Oracle skills I was up for the challenge and felt confident I had the knowhow and experience (<em>plus large balls</em>) to deal with any issues that might crop up and like a true techie I refused to read the manual (<em>text file in the case of Oracle products</em>)…I was in for a bumpy ride it seems.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">* It should be noted here, if you do happen to install the 32 bit client first and/or the Oracle Developer Tools and ODAC (32 bit), you will have seriously random Installation problems trying to install Oracle 64 bit Client (<em>the solution is to follow the instructions further down in this post to remove and clean up your PC</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I went ahead and installed the 64 bit Client, in this case I used the client installation that came provided with the Oracle 11g database installation CD (<em>supplied by the tech support guys</em>), selected <strong>Administrator</strong> as the installation type, pointed the installer to where I wanted the files to go, set the Oracle Home directory and went ahead with the installation (<em>no problems here</em>).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/oracle-installer.jpg?mtime=1359936990" alt="Oracle Installer" width="399" height="274" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">All good so far, put my <strong>TNSNAMES.ORA</strong> file into the  <strong>{Oracle_Home}Product11.2.0Client_X64NetworkAdmin</strong> folder, fired up a Command console and used Sqlplus to connect to an Oracle 11g database server that was supplied by the tech support team, worked like a charm.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After doing this I installed the Xcopy version of the 64 bit ODAC libraries and tools which can only be installed by the command prompt so you need to run a command similar to this in the installation directory:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="background-color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">install.bat all c:oracle OracleHome_Client1 </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Or something similar to the above command which should go ahead and install the required ODAC bits into the proper place (<em>you need to ensure you specify the Oracle Home directory</em>).  Again this went fairly smoothly as well with no hick-ups so up next was the 32 bit client and here you need to make sure you install the Oracle Developer Tools with ODAC which includes the 32 bit client otherwise you will experience much pain as I did (<em>where I installed the 32 bit client, then ODAC and other bits which caused no end of pain due to path problems, mismatched versions of dll’s etc</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The above allows you to correctly use PL/SQL Developer (<em>if you have this cool application installed</em>) as long as you remember to go into the <strong>Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Connection</strong> section and set the OCI Library to the correct location (<em>e.g. {oracle_home}product11.2.0client_1oci.dll or client_1binoci.dll depending on your version</em>) and any other application that requires the 32 bit Oracle Client.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Now the above hard work should be adequate to get a working Developer Workstation with both 64 bit and 32 bit Oracle Clients and Developer Tools however there is always a but…what I didn’t tell you was the amount of pain I went through to get the above installation list right, and believe me it was extremely painful and as I have found out after posting this blog page, there a few other client combinations that can work e.g. having a primary 32 bit Oracle Client installation with the developer tools and a 64 bit Instant Client installation (<em>will save this for a future post</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I spent an awfully long time getting my workstation working and when things did go wrong (<em>which they did a lot, just Google the various issues people have had trying to install and use Oracle clients with their Visual Studio developer machines</em>) I barely got any work done which prompted my colleague to say:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>“We have to do so much administration work, just to get to a solution developed and delivered”</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Which got me thinking, this is very true and probably becoming the norm now with modern development, more so in my case due to the nature of the team I am in i.e. we develop lots of bespoke solutions, integration various systems together, sometimes involving small pieces of development to large scale projects.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What I haven’t shared is the nightmare scenario I ended up in with a totally messed up pair of gac’s (<em>32 bit and 64 bit</em>) and problems compiling any of our projects because they all used one combination or another of the Oracle client (<em>mostly 64 bit now</em>).  So if anyone has had this problem here is the proper way to deal with it…</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Open Command Prompt and change to the directory containing your Oracle client installation and run the deinstall.bat batch script:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="background-color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">{oracle_home}product11.2.0Client_X64Deinstalldeinstall.bat</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Once the de-installation (<em>uninstall to you and me…Oracle people…</em>) is complete you need to run the Oracle Universal Installer (<em>semi-cool Java tool…Java is not cool, the app is however</em>).  When this app fires up you have the option to Deinstall any installations on your system:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/oracle-installer-deinstall.jpg?mtime=1359936990" alt="Oracle Deinstall" width="372" height="270" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Select all the products and then click on Remove to uninstall (<em>deinstall</em>) the products:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/users/kermit/oracle-installer-deinstall-inventory.jpg?mtime=1359936991" alt="Inventory" width="150" height="245" /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have no issues with the uninstallation of the Oracle Client stuff you will need to go into the Windows Registry to make sure you remove any references to an Oracle installation otherwise your future Oracle Client installation exercises will result in broken installations and more headaches.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Edit the registry (click START &gt; type regedit32) and start with the following registry location:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Find the Oracle Key and delete it, do the same for the HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_USERS (<em>you will need to go through the various sub parent keys and find any Oracle sub Keys and delete them</em>). </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Don&#8217;t forget to clear the gac&#8217;s (both 32 bit and 64 bit), I found this the simplest way of doing it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Start Command Prompt for Visual Studio 32 bit</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Type gacutil /l &gt; c:gac32list.txt</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Open the gac32list.txt file and find the word Oracle</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the Command Prompt window type the following commands: </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">gacutil /u Oracle.DataAccess</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">gacutil /u Oracle.Database.Extensions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">gacutil /u Oracle.Web</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Close the Command Prompt window</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Start Command Prompt for Visual Studio 64 bit</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Repeat the above commands</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Close the Command Prompt window</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This should give you a clean installation and hopefully allow you to get a working installation of the Oracle clients on your .NET Developer Workstation.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So back to the question at hand, just what kind of developer does a developer need to be?  Someone who is comfortable at administering their local, virtual and remote computers?  And just how much effort should be made before you require assistance (<em>and will that not take more effort</em>) but what if you work in an environment where the resources are not available and you have to <strong>“man up”</strong> (<em>so to speak</em>) and take the reins, do you factor that into any and every piece of work and project you do?</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Well in an ideal world you would minimize the effort required for each subsequent piece of work and/or project however you cannot avoid the moments when you will simply have to dig into the trenches and get your hands dirty so be prepared to lose half your estimated time (<em>if not more</em>) battling system incompatibilities, software bugs, assembly hell and those gremlins that keep causing you to see spots on your screen (<em>honest</em>).</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Set aside time to climb a difficult mountain and get your hands cut, you will need to work out the many holes in your nice setup and as more and more technical requirements popup don’t expect everything to work well together the first time (<em>you have to integrate your own development environment first</em>). </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So key here is to develop the expertise if you don’t have it at hand, become adaptable but remain honest to yourself (<em>you will have to go through some pain to get to the fruits of your labour</em>).  Use knowledge base tools (<em>Wiki</em>) to record your efforts, communicate your findings with your colleagues and attempt to automate and make reusable as much of what you use as possible.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; tab-stops: 522.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This will help you better deal with those moments when you have to spend most of your effort on the administration of your development work as appose to the actual developing and as a bonus increase your skills repertoire which every modern developer shouldn’t shy away from (<em>becoming more agile in nature by having a can-do attitude</em>).</span></span></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/sysadmins/security/don-t-fall-for-the/"><![CDATA[<p>I am pretty sure that none of our readers would fall for this social engineering scam that would make you share your computer with someone else, I am writing about it because I know of one person who had a call like this but she luckily hung up.</p>
<p>I heard about this on Twit&#8217;s <a href="http://twit.tv/sn">Security Now</a>( With Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte ). Here is how it works, you will get a call from someone based in India working for Microsoft telling you that your computer is infected. The first thing they do is tell you to go to start/run box, type <em>eventvwr </em>and it will bring up Windows Event Viewer. Now they have you go to the aplication folder and look at all the errors that are there, this is because the computer is infected. </p>
<p>Of course everyone that has been using windows for a while will know that it will always have errors.</p>
<p>The next part is pretty funny&#8230;.</p>
<p>They will tell you to go back to the Run box and type &#8220;inf&#8221;, then they will tell you that inf stands for <strong>infected files</strong>.  They make you go to C:Windowsinf After you are there they will ask you if you can you see a lot of .inf and .pnf files in the INF directory. If you say yes, and you will, they will tell you that those are corrupted files. Next they will tell you to double-click one of the PNF files.  Once you double-click it, you will see an error message like the one below</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/pnffile.PNG?mtime=1326496203"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/pnffile.PNG?mtime=1326496203" width="412" height="252" /></a></div>
<p>This, they will tell you is proof that your machine is infected.</p>
<p>After that they will tell you that to fix it you need to do the following. Go to the Run box and type www.ammyy.com. Ammyy Admin &#8211; is a popular config-zero free remote desktop sharing software. It&#8217;s used for system administration, webinars and instant remote desktop access. So next they will take over your system by using this tool</p>
<p>Here is a also a video that someone recorded</p>
[video:youtube:cueN1-2lANA]
<p>So if you or any of the people you know get any of these calls, just tell them to hung up.</p>

<p>Did you know that you can call this from the command line also? I just saw this on  Raymond Chen&#8217;s blog today: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/22/10177613.aspx</p>
<p>I decided to try it out</p>
<p>The command is compact , here are all the switches</p>
<pre>C:UsersSQLDenis&gt;compact /?
Displays or alters the compression of files on NTFS partitions.

COMPACT [/C | /U] [/S[:dir]] [/A] [/I] [/F] [/Q] [filename [...]]

  /C        Compresses the specified files.  Directories will be marked
            so that files added afterward will be compressed.
  /U        Uncompresses the specified files.  Directories will be marked
            so that files added afterward will not be compressed.
  /S        Performs the specified operation on files in the given
            directory and all subdirectories.  Default "dir" is the
            current directory.
  /A        Displays files with the hidden or system attributes.  These
            files are omitted by default.
  /I        Continues performing the specified operation even after errors
            have occurred.  By default, COMPACT stops when an error is
            encountered.
  /F        Forces the compress operation on all specified files, even
            those which are already compressed.  Already-compressed files
            are skipped by default.
  /Q        Reports only the most essential information.
  filename  Specifies a pattern, file, or directory.

  Used without parameters, COMPACT displays the compression state of
  the current directory and any files it contains. You may use multiple
  filenames and wildcards.  You must put spaces between multiple
  parameters.</pre>
<p>I have a temp folder on my C drive, first I want to see if anything is compressed, I will run <strong>compact /Q</strong> to get some information</p>

<p>As you can see, the files are compressed and the ratio is 4.2 to 1</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be useful for some of you that copy files and then want to compress files after the copy process is done</p>

<p>If you have been patching your Windows 7 machine then you already have most of what is in the service pack, the service pack is just a rollup of all the patches that have been issued since Windows 7 was released.

<h2>Using the Built-In Email</h2>
<p>Windows Vista, 7, and 2008 have a built-in option that allows us to attach actions to events from the event log. These actions take the form of Tasks, similar to scheduled tasks with the exception that they are trigger by events rather than time. The services infrastructure in windows logs startup and shutdown events for services and many applications use the event log rather than a custom logging format. We can take advantage of these messages to create a notification that emails us when certain events occur.</p>
<p>First we need an example of the event and, being lazy, I&#8217;m going to generate one the easy way. Shutting down a SQL Server service generates the first event I want to track (and makes SQL admins everywhere cringe a little, mission accomplished). Later in the post we&#8217;ll cover creating tasks without restarting our server, since people tend to get upset when we do things like that in production.</p>
<p>When we open the Event Log from Administrative Tools menu in Windows, there are several logs available. SQL Server and other service log entries are logged to the Application log. To create my new event-driven task, I locate the entry I just created, right click it, and select &#8220;Attach Task to This Event&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/orig/01_screen.png" title="View Fullsize" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/01_screen.png" alt="Attach Task to Event Dialog" /></a><br />
	Attach Task to Event &#8211; Dialog
</div>
<p>The Task creation option presents us with a fairly simple dialog. To be consistent and build good habits, we fill in a descriptive name and description for the task. </p>
<div class="hint">
Filling in descriptive names and descriptions for items like tasks may seem like a waste of time, but it&#8217;s 20s of content now that will save a whole lot of digging around 4 years from now when you need to change it. Also, if I ever visit your shop I will make fun of you for not using a descriptive name <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</div>
<div class="screenshot">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/orig/02_screen.png" title="View Fullsize" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/02_screen.png" alt="Names are Important" /></a><br />
	Names are Important
</div>
<p>The second step doesn&#8217;t require (or allow) an input and the third step presents us with the simple decision of sending an email, launching an executable, or displaying a message. We are here to send an email, so the choice should be obvious (but I still pressed the wrong one the second time through). </p>
<div class="screenshot">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/orig/03_screen.png" title="View Fullsize" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/03_screen.png" alt="Email Info" /></a><br />
	Information for Email
</div>
<p>After filling the email options out we continue to the last tab to review the task information before finishing. At this point we will want to check the &#8220;open properties&#8221; checkbox and press &#8220;Finish&#8221;.</p>
<p>After completing the wizard, we now have the full properties dialog for the task. Perhaps the most critical item here is to change the radio selection on the first tab to &#8220;Run whether user is logged in or not&#8221;. There is also an OS configuration box that I changed to Windows 2008 R2/Windows 7, but I am not sure whether this provides an addition features or simply satisfaction from making such an important decision.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/orig/04_screen.png" title="View Fullsize" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/04_screen.png" alt="Change Summary - Finished" /></a><br />
Summary before Finishing
</div>
<p>I have enough of the task filled in now that we can now press the OK button and try it out. We open Server Manager from the pinned icon on the taskbar (or via the search mechanism in the Start menu). On expanding &#8220;Configuration/Task Scheduler/Task Scheduler Libary&#8221; and selecting &#8220;Event Viewer Tasks&#8221; we should see the task we created. Right clicking the task and pressing &#8220;Run&#8221; will force the task to run once (again, just like testing a scheduled task). We can select the History tab to see the details of the run or wait patiently for an email to show up in our inbox.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
	<a href="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/orig/05_screen.png" title="View Fullsize" target="_blank"><img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/EventMonitor/05_screen.png" alt="Event Viewer Tasks view" /></a><br />
Event Viewer Tasks view
</div>
<p>And there we have it, an email each time our service stops.</p>
<h2>Alignment of the Stars</h2>
<p>If your mail server is like mine then it probably doesn&#8217;t allow anonymous relaying. If you are using Exchange and you are sending from the same account that you configured the task for (or the user is allowed to send for other users), then you may have received an email. Checking the alignment of the stars may also be of assistance. </p>
<p>Even if the email did work, it is going to be rather tedious to create individual tasks for each of the potential events (SQL Server start/stop, SQL Agent Start/Stop, etc) that you are interested in.</p>
<p>Rather than build a hard-coded email task for each possible event, there is an option to run an executable. Tie that to Cscript.exe and a VBScript (or maybe a powershell script?) and you have a lot more flexibility to send emails. </p>
<p>If you decide to go this route, you will probably want to edit your tasks to carry some additional information (like which event is firing). This will allow you to create a single script and task for multiple events:<br />
http://blogs.technet.com/b/otto/archive/2007/11/09/find-the-event-that-triggered-your-task.aspx</p>
<h2>Not Perfect</h2>
<p>This method of reporting from windows does not replace an external monitoring system. There is a wide range of errors that services and executables can generate. Covering them all would be extremely difficult even if we ignored errors that cause the box to lose communications or freeze entirely. However, if you have no budget at all, setting up some of these alerts will only cost you time and it will at least get you one step closer to knowing about problems before the phone rings.</p>

<p>If you open the host file in the following location C:WindowsSystem32driversetc with notepad and then you want to save it you will get one of these errors in Win 7/Vista/Server 2008</p>
<p><strong>Access to C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts was denied</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cannot create the C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts file.<br />
Make sure that the path and file name are correct.</strong></p>
<p>I am getting the following error on my Windows 7 machine</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/error.png" alt="" title="" width="395" height="184" /></div>
<p>In order to fix this you first need to run notepad as an adminstrator. Here is how you do this. Click Start&#8211;>All Programs&#8211;>Accessories, right-click on Notepad, and then click Run as administrator. This might ask you for a password, enter it</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins//RunAsAdmin.png" alt="" title="" width="270" height="162" /></div>
<p>Now from notepad press CTRL + O (or File&#8211;> Open) and navigate to the host file after you make your changes save it..that should work.</p>
<p>I like to use the MVPS HOSTS file, this file is pretty extensive, it has over 16000 entries. Since my PC is used by my wife and my oldest son this is some extra protection that I have in case they get to a bad site.</p>
<p>Here is just a small sample of entries in this host file</p>

<p>What about you, do you use the host file to block bad sites?</p>
