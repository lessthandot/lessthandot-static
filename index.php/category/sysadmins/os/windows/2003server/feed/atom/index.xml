		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/sysadmins/os/windows/getting-remote-mount-point-information/"><![CDATA[<p>In a previous post I showed how to <a href="/index.php/SysAdmins/OS/Windows/getting-remote-disk-information-with">get remote disk information with PowerShell</a>. The script works nice until you execute it on a server with Mount Points. When executing the following script on a server with Mount Points:</p>
<pre>Get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk -computer &lt;computername&gt; | 
select-object DeviceID, VolumeName, @{Name="Size";Expression={$_.Size/1GB}},@{Name="FreeSpace";Expression={$_.FreeSpace/1GB}},
@{Name="PCTFreeSpace";Expression={
$_.FreeSpace/$_.Size*100}}|Sort-Object -descending PCTfreespace|format-table</pre>
<p>I get the following result:</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP1.JPG?mtime=1354195164"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP1.JPG?mtime=1354195164" width="977" height="144" /></a></div>
<p>Knowing the sizes of my databases, I knew the numbers were wrong. So I opened a RDP session to the server and found this picture in Disk Management:</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP2.JPG?mtime=1354195179"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP2.JPG?mtime=1354195179" width="810" height="530" /></a></div>
<p>At that moment I realized I wasn&#8217;t getting the information from the Mount Points, just from the Disks that had a drive letter assigned to them.<br />
So let&#8217;s find out how we can get that information with Windows PowerShell. I still need the wmiobject but instead of the win32_logicaldisk I&#8217;m going to use the win32_volume. I also replace the DeviceID and VolumeName objects with Name and Label:</p>
<pre>get-wmiobject win32_volume -computer &lt;computername|
select name, label, driveletter</pre>
<p>The result looks like this:</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP3.JPG?mtime=1354195191"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP3.JPG?mtime=1354195191" width="733" height="200" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see, the drive letter properties are empty for my Mount Points and in the name column I can find the file and folder where they are mounted.<br />
So let&#8217;s find the space, free space and percentage free space of the volumes. I can use the calculations from my previous script only Size needs to be replaced with Capacity:</p>
<pre>get-wmiobject win32_volume -computer &lt;computername|
select name, label, @{Name="Capacity (GB)";Expression={$_.Capacity/1GB}},@{Name="FreeSpace (GB)";Expression={$_.FreeSpace/1GB}},
@{Name="FreeSpace (PCT)";Expression={$_.FreeSpace/$_.Capacity*100}} |
format-table</pre>
<p>The result now shows the drives and Mount Points with all the requested information:</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP4.JPG?mtime=1354195223"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/SysAdmins/FSMP4.JPG?mtime=1354195223" width="964" height="186" /></a></div>
<p>To be able to reuse the script I do what I did in the other two PowerShell post:</p>
<pre>param(
	[string] $compname = $(Throw "Provide a Server name as first parameter")
)
Get-WmiObject win32_volume -computer $compname |
select name, label, @{Name="Capacity (GB)";Expression={$_.Capacity/1GB}},
@{Name="FreeSpace (GB)";Expression={$_.FreeSpace/1GB}},
@{Name="FreeSpace (PCT)";Expression={$_.FreeSpace/$_.Capacity*100}} |
format-table</pre>
<p>End that&#8217;s it, the next request for free disk space is a matter of seconds again.</p>

<p>Do you still remember  <a href="/index.php/SysAdmins/OS/win32-conficker-b-also-known-as-downadup">Conficker, also known as Downup, Downadup and Kido</a>? Conficker infected between 9 million and 15 million PCs<br />
Here are just some examples that I pulled down from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker#Impact_in_Europe">wikipedia</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Intramar, the French Navy computer network, was infected with Conficker on 15 January 2009. The network was subsequently quarantined, forcing aircraft at several airbases to be grounded because their flight plans could not be downloaded.</li>
<li>
The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence reported that some of its major systems and desktops were infected. The virus has spread across administrative offices, NavyStar/N* desktops aboard various Royal Navy warships and Royal Navy submarines, and hospitals across the city of Sheffield reported infection of over 800 computers.</li>
<li>
On 2 February 2009, the Bundeswehr, the unified armed forces of Germany reported that about one hundred of their computers were infected.</li>
<li>
An infection of Manchester City Council&#8217;s IT system caused an estimated Â£1.5m worth of disruption in February 2009. USB flash drives have since been banned, as this was believed to be the vector for the initial infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802119832/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802119832">Worm: The First Digital World War</a> by Mark Bowden and decided to check it out since I already read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000957/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sql08-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0142000957">Killing Pablo</a> which was written by Mark Bowden as well</p>
<p>The book is written for people who are not familiar with all the terms that most IT people know. Things like TCP/IP, ports, RPC and buffer overflow are all explained in very simple ways, an IT person might think that this book is too simple for him or her. The part of the book which I found of most interest is the infighting between the members of the <a href="http://www.confickerworkinggroup.org/wiki/">Conficker Cabal</a> (later renamed to the Conficker Working Group). The cluelessness from the US government was interesting as well.</p>
<p>The book takes you through how the Conficker worm started to infect computers to the cat and mouse game that followed between the Conficker creator and the Conficker Cabal. Also covered is a general history of worms and viruses/virii so that you can see that each virus is based on some elements of the previous one.</p>
<p>The book is only 245 pages and it is a very easy read with a nice size font. If you don&#8217;t know anything about Conficker, I think this is a good book to read. If you already know about Conficker and followed it then I don&#8217;t think you will find a lot of new things in this book that have not been discussed before, however I think that this book will still be of interest to you, the Conficker Cabal stuff was the most interesting part to me</p>
<p>In the end I would recommend this book and I think you will enjoy it.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/sysadmins/os/windows/2003server/is-your-apache-server-status/"><![CDATA[<p>The Apache web server comes with something called Apache Module mod_status installed</p>
<p>From the Apache site: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_status.html</p>
<blockquote><p>The Status module allows a server administrator to find out how well their server is performing. A HTML page is presented that gives the current server statistics in an easily readable form. If required this page can be made to automatically refresh (given a compatible browser). Another page gives a simple machine-readable list of the current server state.</p>
<p>The details given are:</p>
<p>The number of worker serving requests<br />
The number of idle worker<br />
The status of each worker, the number of requests that worker has performed and the total number of bytes served by the worker (*)<br />
A total number of accesses and byte count served (*)<br />
The time the server was started/restarted and the time it has been running for<br />
Averages giving the number of requests per second, the number of bytes served per second and the average number of bytes per request (*)<br />
The current percentage CPU used by each worker and in total by Apache (*)<br />
The current hosts and requests being processed (*)</p></blockquote>
<p>If you go to a site that uses the Apache web server, you can get interesting info if you add server-status after the domain name</p>
<p>If you go to http://apache.org/server-status, you will get the following</p>
<p>Server Version: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.0g<br />
Server Built: Mar 3 2012 19:35:24<br />
Current Time: Friday, 23-Mar-2012 00:20:33 UTC<br />
Restart Time: Tuesday, 20-Mar-2012 16:36:59 UTC<br />
Parent Server Config. Generation: 4<br />
Parent Server MPM Generation: 3<br />
Server uptime: 2 days 7 hours 43 minutes 34 seconds<br />
Total accesses: 41598844 &#8211; Total Traffic: 571.4 GB<br />
CPU Usage: u1734.41 s1457.05 cu0 cs0 &#8211; 1.59% CPU load<br />
207 requests/sec &#8211; 2.9 MB/second &#8211; 14.4 kB/request<br />
24 requests currently being processed, 616 idle workers</p>
<p>This will be followed by a list of IP addresses and pages that were served.</p>
<p>This can potentially be dangerous, it doesn&#8217;t long to write a program that will crawl the web and checking if it gets anything back when hitting domains with server-status appended</p>
<p>Several high traffic site have this enabled, just hit http://www.washingtonpost.com/ or http://boston.com/ and add server-status</p>
<p>What do you think, is this a problem or meh? I think it could be a problem, attackers now can now if you have an unpatched version of Apache running and they can take advantage of that.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />
And it seems that washingtonpost.com disabled it. As of this morning you see this instead</p>
<p><em>Forbidden</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have permission to access /server-status on this server.</p>
<p>Apache Server at failover.washingtonpost.com Port 80</em></p>

<h2>Mobile stats</h2>
<p>Mobile device will surpass desktop and laptops in the next year or two. Here is what the percentages looked like from visits to Lessthandot.</p>

<p>And here it is as a chart</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisgobo/6600120215/" title="Mobile2011 by Denis Gobo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6600120215_b303b8940c_b.jpg" width="709" height="413" alt="Mobile2011" /></a><br />
Android is the clear winner here, but iOS is still bigger if you add iPhone and iPad together. You can also see that the Nokia launch of the windows phone has some success because windows phone shot up to 4% from less than 0.5% for most of the year</p>

<p>I heard about this on Twit&#8217;s <a href="http://twit.tv/sn">Security Now</a>( With Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte ). Here is how it works, you will get a call from someone based in India working for Microsoft telling you that your computer is infected. The first thing they do is tell you to go to start/run box, type <em>eventvwr </em>and it will bring up Windows Event Viewer. Now they have you go to the aplication folder and look at all the errors that are there, this is because the computer is infected. </p>
<p>Of course everyone that has been using windows for a while will know that it will always have errors.</p>
<p>The next part is pretty funny&#8230;.</p>
<p>They will tell you to go back to the Run box and type &#8220;inf&#8221;, then they will tell you that inf stands for <strong>infected files</strong>.  They make you go to C:Windowsinf After you are there they will ask you if you can you see a lot of .inf and .pnf files in the INF directory. If you say yes, and you will, they will tell you that those are corrupted files. Next they will tell you to double-click one of the PNF files.  Once you double-click it, you will see an error message like the one below</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/pnffile.PNG?mtime=1326496203"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/All/pnffile.PNG?mtime=1326496203" width="412" height="252" /></a></div>
<p>This, they will tell you is proof that your machine is infected.</p>
<p>After that they will tell you that to fix it you need to do the following. Go to the Run box and type www.ammyy.com. Ammyy Admin &#8211; is a popular config-zero free remote desktop sharing software. It&#8217;s used for system administration, webinars and instant remote desktop access. So next they will take over your system by using this tool</p>
<p>Here is a also a video that someone recorded</p>
[video:youtube:cueN1-2lANA]
<p>So if you or any of the people you know get any of these calls, just tell them to hung up.</p>

<p>Here is the &#8220;press release&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Friends around the globe,</p>
<p>We are Lulz Security, and this is our final release, as today marks something meaningful to us. 50 days ago, we set sail with our humble ship on an uneasy and brutal ocean: the Internet. The hate machine, the love machine, the machine powered by many machines. We are all part of it, helping it grow, and helping it grow on us.</p>
<p>For the past 50 days we&#8217;ve been disrupting and exposing corporations, governments, often the general population itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because we could. All to selflessly entertain others &#8211; vanity, fame, recognition, all of these things are shadowed by our desire for that which we all love. The raw, uninterrupted, chaotic thrill of entertainment and anarchy. It&#8217;s what we all crave, even the seemingly lifeless politicians and emotionless, middle-aged self-titled failures. You are not failures. You have not blown away. You can get what you want and you are worth having it, believe in yourself.</p>
<p>While we are responsible for everything that The Lulz Boat is, we are not tied to this identity permanently. Behind this jolly visage of rainbows and top hats, we are people. People with a preference for music, a preference for food; we have varying taste in clothes and television, we are just like you. Even Hitler and Osama Bin Laden had these unique variations and style, and isn&#8217;t that interesting to know? The mediocre painter turned supervillain liked cats more than we did.</p>
<p>Again, behind the mask, behind the insanity and mayhem, we truly believe in the AntiSec movement. We believe in it so strongly that we brought it back, much to the dismay of those looking for more anarchic lulz. We hope, wish, even beg, that the movement manifests itself into a revolution that can continue on without us. The support we&#8217;ve gathered for it in such a short space of time is truly overwhelming, and not to mention humbling. Please don&#8217;t stop. Together, united, we can stomp down our common oppressors and imbue ourselves with the power and freedom we deserve.</p>
<p>So with those last thoughts, it&#8217;s time to say bon voyage. Our planned 50 day cruise has expired, and we must now sail into the distance, leaving behind &#8211; we hope &#8211; inspiration, fear, denial, happiness, approval, disapproval, mockery, embarrassment, thoughtfulness, jealousy, hate, even love. If anything, we hope we had a microscopic impact on someone, somewhere. Anywhere.</p>
<p>Thank you for sailing with us. The breeze is fresh and the sun is setting, so now we head for the horizon.</p>
<p>Let it flow&#8230;</p>
<p>Lulz Security &#8211; our crew of six wishes you a happy 2011, and a shout-out to all of our battlefleet members and supporters across the globe</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Our mayhem: http://lulzsecurity.com/releases/<br />
Our chaos: http://thepiratebay.org/user/LulzSec/<br />
Our final release: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6495523/50_Days_of_Lulz</p>
<p>Please make mirrors of material on the website, because we&#8217;re not renewing the hosting. Goodbye. &lt;3</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that this has caused enough problems so that in the future we won&#8217;t see companies storing passwords unencrypted in clear text. Overall I think this was probably needed to show what state the industry was in, every day I woke up, I wondered who was hacked today. </p>
<p>Hopefully all the companies that were not hacked got a wake up call and they are investigating their security of their systems and making the necessary changes to harden their systems. And never, I mean never store customer data in plain text, this will bite you back sooner or later.</p>

<p>Did you know that you can call this from the command line also? I just saw this on  Raymond Chen&#8217;s blog today: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/22/10177613.aspx</p>
<p>I decided to try it out</p>
<p>The command is compact , here are all the switches</p>
<pre>C:UsersSQLDenis&gt;compact /?
Displays or alters the compression of files on NTFS partitions.

COMPACT [/C | /U] [/S[:dir]] [/A] [/I] [/F] [/Q] [filename [...]]

  /C        Compresses the specified files.  Directories will be marked
            so that files added afterward will be compressed.
  /U        Uncompresses the specified files.  Directories will be marked
            so that files added afterward will not be compressed.
  /S        Performs the specified operation on files in the given
            directory and all subdirectories.  Default "dir" is the
            current directory.
  /A        Displays files with the hidden or system attributes.  These
            files are omitted by default.
  /I        Continues performing the specified operation even after errors
            have occurred.  By default, COMPACT stops when an error is
            encountered.
  /F        Forces the compress operation on all specified files, even
            those which are already compressed.  Already-compressed files
            are skipped by default.
  /Q        Reports only the most essential information.
  filename  Specifies a pattern, file, or directory.

  Used without parameters, COMPACT displays the compression state of
  the current directory and any files it contains. You may use multiple
  filenames and wildcards.  You must put spaces between multiple
  parameters.</pre>
<p>I have a temp folder on my C drive, first I want to see if anything is compressed, I will run <strong>compact /Q</strong> to get some information</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/sysadmins/os/vulnerability-in-microsoft-video-activex/"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bad one if you are running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 with Internet Explorer. If you are running Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 then you are not affected</p>
<p>The bad part about this is that all it takes for you is to visit a bad site. If you are using Chrome (like me), FireFox or Safari then you are not affected by this. Microsoft really should redesign IE from scratch and get rid of all that ActiveX baggage/nonsense, it is not worth it, it only causes troubles. Almost every IE vulnerability is ActiveX based.</p>
<p><em>Mitigating Factors:</p>
<p>Customers who are using Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 are not affected because the ability to pass data to this control within Internet Explorer has been restricted.</p>
<p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>
<p>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker&#8217;s Web site.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</em></p>
<p><strong>There are 2 ways to do something about this</strong><br />
1) Visit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/972890.mspx">Microsoft Security Advisory (972890)</a> and look in the workaround section where you will find a way so that you can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p>2) Use the fix it button on this page  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/972890</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/sysadmins/os/cidaemon-exe-process-cpu-usage-on-window/"><![CDATA[<p>One of my Windows Server 2003 R2 boxes started showing CPU bumps of 0 to 10% late last night.  In investigating this a process cidaemon.exe was found to be the process causing the small but consistent utilization.</p>
<p>This process is associated with full text indexing on Windows.  Even if you don&#8217;t use full text indexing, Windows does.  I found 3 catalogs setup on the server.  One of the defaults being the system volume.  Repeated attempts to configure full text indexing and fix the wild CPU usage all failed.  The only way I was able to fix this problem was the delete the catalogs and recreate them.  After that full text indexing went back to normal processing and cidaemon.exe was sent to the bottom of the processes list in task manager.</p>
<p>If you come across this fix it quickly.  From my research this issue will build and CPU usage can raise up to 70% over my 10% average.</p>
<p>To find out what catalogs you have do the following. (you can do this on any Windows XP Pro and up OS)</p>
<p>Click Start&#8211;>Search<br />
In the Right menu click &#8220;Change Preferences&#8221;<br />
Then click &#8220;With Indexing Service (for faster local searches&#8221;<br />
Then click &#8220;Change indexing service settings (advanced)</p>
<p>This opens the snap for indexing service.  Write down you catalogs if you want to recreate them.  Note: I found no valid reasoning to actually recreate these catalogs although I felt better putting the system back in the state it was.</p>
<p>First you have to stop them.  Right click the catalog&#8211;>All tasks&#8211;>Stop<br />
Then delete them and recreate if you see fit.</p>
<p>cidaemon.exe of course is ended when you stop indexing service.  The test is when you recreate and start the catalogs.  You should see full text indexing and the cidaemon.exe process acting as it should utilizing 1% CPU and no more along with no more memory than around 2400K</p>
