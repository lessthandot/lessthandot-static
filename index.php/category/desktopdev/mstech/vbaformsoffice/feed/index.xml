				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I have moved back over to the not-so-technical side, I find that I am having to relearn things that I probably knew a long time before but have forgotten. As I have pointed out to my friends before, I don&#8217;t care so much about what tools I use so long as the job gets done. However, since I don&#8217;t have ready access to dev tools at this job (since I&#8217;m not a developer in this role), I have to go back to more common office tools. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, mind you, just something that I have to do and there are ups and downs to it.</p>
<p>I was recently asked to go manually update a bunch of Word documents with specific formatting. I hate to do things manually so naturally I sought out a way to make it go faster. Because of the formatting issues of the docs, a macro was not the most efficient method. However, I recalled that I could set my own keyboard shortcuts &#8211; woohoo! In MS Word 2007, it&#8217;s actually pretty straightforward. First, click on the Office button in the top left corner. This will provide the base-level menu list. </p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard1.JPG?mtime=1330380437"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard1.JPG?mtime=1330380437" width="429" height="477" /></a></div>
<p>On this menu list, click on the &#8220;Word Options&#8221; button at the bottom right of the menu list. On the list on the left-hand side, click on &#8220;Customize&#8221;. You will then see the following:</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard2.JPG?mtime=1330351484"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard2.JPG?mtime=1330351484" width="840" height="685" /></a></div>
<p>At the bottom, click on &#8220;Customize&#8221; next to &#8220;Keyboard shortcuts:&#8221; in order to view all of the menu items and to enable the creation/modification of keyboard shortcuts. That will bring up the option to customize any keyboard commands. Below, you can see that I&#8217;ve updated the Highlight to use the default setting (Alt-Ctrl-H) which I found didn&#8217;t work as I wanted and the Alt-Q that I added and which is easier for me to use. The same, obviously, can be done for any changes that you may also wish to make.</p>
<div class="image_block"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard3.JPG?mtime=1330351825"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard3.JPG?mtime=1330351825" width="574" height="441" /></a></div>
<p>It is little shortcuts like these that create efficiencies and, at the end of the day, shorten the time I need to do things manually and enable me to accomplish more. Hopefully this will point the way to doing the same for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever needed to remove the time part of a date variable, or remove the date part of a date variable?  I recently had a requirement to do this, and my first reaction was to use the format function because it is very flexible and quite simple to use.  Unfortunately, it does&#8217;t perform very well.</p>
<p>First, the format method for removing the time part.</p>
<pre>&lt;span class="MT_blue"&gt;Debug.Print Format(Now, "Short Date")
4/1/2009

Debug.Print Format(Now, "Short Time")
09:16&lt;/span&gt; </pre>
<p>Seems simple enough to remove the date and/or time portion of a date variable, but is it the best way?  If you only want to display it, it probably is, but if you need to use the values for calculations, it is not the best way to remove the date or time portions.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the Int function.</p>
<p>The Int function performs a simple truncate on a number.  Note:  this does not do rounding.  Also significant is that Int will return whatever data is sent to it.  If the parameter is a double, int will return a double.  If the parameter is a single, Int returns a single, if the parameter is a date, Int returns a date.</p>
<pre>&lt;span class="MT_blue"&gt;Debug.Print Int(Now)
4/1/2009 

Debug.Print Now - Int(Now)
0.390729166669189 &lt;/span&gt; </pre>
<p>Surprised to see a number instead of a time? Me too.  But&#8230; in VB6, when you subtract dates, the resulting data type is a double.</p>
<pre>&lt;span class="MT_blue"&gt;Debug.Print TypeName(Now - Int(Now))
Double&lt;/span&gt; </pre>
<p>However, this double can be converted back to a Date variable type like this.</p>
<pre>&lt;span class="MT_blue"&gt;Debug.Print cDate(Now - Int(Now))
9:25:40 AM&lt;/span&gt; </pre>
<p>Clearly, there are 2 different methods for separating the date from the time in a Date variable.  Which is better?  They both return the correct value, so now it&#8217;s up to performance.</p>
<p>I tested the performance with this code:</p>
<pre>Option Explicit

Private Sub Command1_Click()

    Dim i As Long
    Dim dteTemp As Date
    Dim Start As Single
    
    Start = Timer
    For i = 1 To 1000000
        dteTemp = RemoveDate(Now)
    Next
    Call MsgBox(Format(Timer - Start, "0.00") &amp; " micro-seconds")
    
    Start = Timer
    For i = 1 To 1000000
        dteTemp = RemoveDateWithFormat(Now)
    Next
    Call MsgBox(Format(Timer - Start, "0.00") &amp; " micro-seconds")
    
End Sub

Private Function RemoveDateWithFormat(ByVal DateTime As Date) As Date
    
    RemoveDateWithFormat = Format(DateTime, "h:mm")

End Function

Private Function RemoveDate(ByVal DateTime As Date) As Date
    
    RemoveDate = DateTime - Int(DateTime)
    
End Function</pre>
<p>The Int method runs in 0.40 micro-seconds and the Format method takes 3 micro-seconds.  The Int method is approximately 7 times faster.</p>
