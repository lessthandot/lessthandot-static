		<description><![CDATA[Hello - This is very detailed - much better than what I&#039;ve come across.  This issue I am having, though, is that all the different documentation I&#039;ve seen talks about removing a database from the High Availability group, which was quite easy, but not what it takes to add it back in.  I have an issue where I needed to take a database out temporarily as Sharepoint wanted to update it.  Seemed rather simple just to take it out, but the database went into simple mode, so I had to change that back to Full and do a backup, but it is still saying there is an issue in the fact that there is an existing database on the replica.  How do I add it back, once I&#039;ve taken it out?  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Pieter, although I don&#039;t agree completely on the points being added here as they are not part of what availability groups is.  The ownership of a database is due to restoring under a user account, which should be corrected in any case of a restore (I see you&#039;ve given that corrected method in your blog you referred to - nicely done).  Logins, SQL Agent Jobs, and everything else outside the control of AG, falls into the high availability strategy, not AG specifically.  Those types of objects, as you said, should be moved but they are again, not part of AG.  The same situations exist for mirroring, not just AG.  On a side note - copying the logins is not simply enough unless you failover and manually map the orphaned user to login.  So you should be placing a script, like my fix orphaned users script, on the replicas and have it run in the event a failover occurs, by catching the xevent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ted,

Thanks for sharing this, interesting post.
I think it&#039;s also worth to mention that you should copy your server logins to the secondary replica&#039;s in case you don&#039;t use contained databases. The same for specific database jobs and maintenance jobs.
I&#039;ve also noticed that the owner of the secondary database will be the login that is performing the restore. I&#039;ve written a blog post about it here http://pietervanhove.azurewebsites.net/?p=3769

But again, good post and thanks for sharing

Regards
Pieter]]></description>
