I thank you if you want to, but I won this same prize at another blog, and am removed from winning in this one!

My project will need tools included in a MSDN ultimate subscription, but those tools (like Expression Studio) are way too expansive&#8230; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a project will help people who use internet to sync their files and settings between their work place, home, and cybercafe &#8212; I don&#8217;t know how is cybercafe going in the US, but in China many people still use cybercafe &#8212; It will need web access, shell integration, WPF and Silverlight, and I also need to test it on multi platforms, I believe a MSDN subscription is the best tool can help me with the project.</p>
<p>Do I still have a chance?</p>
