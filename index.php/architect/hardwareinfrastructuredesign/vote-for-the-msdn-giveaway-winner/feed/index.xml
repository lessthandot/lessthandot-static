		<description><![CDATA[Is that too late to submit my answer?&lt;br /&gt;
My project will need tools included in a MSDN ultimate subscription, but those tools (like Expression Studio) are way too expansive... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m working on a project will help people who use internet to sync their files and settings between their work place, home, and cybercafe -- I don&#039;t know how is cybercafe going in the US, but in China many people still use cybercafe -- It will need web access, shell integration, WPF and Silverlight, and I also need to test it on multi platforms, I believe a MSDN subscription is the best tool can help me with the project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do I still have a chance?]]></description>
