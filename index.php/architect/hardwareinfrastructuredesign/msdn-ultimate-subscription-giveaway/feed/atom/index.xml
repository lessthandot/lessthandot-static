What are you going to build with this &#8211; I am going to build practice apps to learn from, as I am relatively new to development<br />
will it help other people&#8217;s lives? It is my hope that training myself will get me into a job in which I am helping other people.</p>
<p>2) What specific functionality that is only part of Ultimate are you going to use? &#8211; Architecture Explorer</p>
<p>3) You need to have a technical blog and provide the URL to that blog, if you are an active member of the technical community (stackoverflow, msdn forums etc etc) then also include those links. &#8211; <a href="http://dyfhid.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dyfhid.wordpress.com/</a>.

A few years back I started doing some database development on the side, but then I got married, had a son, and began having some health challenges which together halted what I&#8217;d been doing.</p>
<p>But there is a special opportunity coming to me this Saturday to get back into the swing of things: my wife and son will be leaving the country for six weeks. I had already been planning to devote myself to developing one of many application ideas, but now:</p>
<p>1) I would use MSDN Ultimate Subscription to build a secure server/file transfer/fetching/archiving/processing/reconciling/user worklist managing/cross-platform system (uncannily and quite coincidentally, exactly what is desperately needed at a company I know). It will help other people&#8217;s lives in several ways: filling a need that many companies are bound to  have and for a low price (as initially I will need to build market presence more than profit); increasing the number of small software development businesses out there, proving again that it can be done and providing inspiration for the masses; getting a family&#8217;s Dad home so he can spend more time with them. If it helps, I&#8217;ll blog about the development and growth of my application and business.</p>
<p>2) The functionality I would use that is unique to VS Ultimate is Architecture and Modeling. I believe in &#8220;starting the way you mean to finish.&#8221; So even though I&#8217;ll be a one-man shop at first, that means test-driven design, agile development, automated regression testing, version control, good backups, and all the infrastructure needed to hire employees when the time comes without having to change much. I&#8217;ll be eager to add the layer diagramming abilities of VS Ultimate to this mix.</p>
<p>3. Blogs and technical community activity:</p>

I just can&#8217;t stop coding and building websites but it would really help to have the most awesome tools that an MSDN ultimate subscription provides.</p>
<p>2) Well definitely the architecture explorer, you can visualise all the relationships between your assemblies &#8211; how cool is that? But you can count on me fiddling about with just about everything!</p>

<p>I am a software developer having more than two years of experience. I always believe in sharing my knowledge with community.</p>
<p>Ans 1) I need it to improve my knowledge so that I can build better applications and using that I can be useful to community. I have some idea in mind to develop some a portal from which one can get instant help on any topic.</p>
<p>Ans 2)I am going to use Architecture and modeling and Application life cycle management.</p>
<p>Ans 3)here is my blog link.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/index.php/architect/hardwareinfrastructuredesign/msdn-ultimate-subscription-giveaway/#comment-2939"><![CDATA[<p>1)I wish to start working on tools and services that will allow for rapid development and management of webbased telephony api services such as Twilio, Tropo, Cloudvox, etc. I feel that these are much needed tools in this new segment of the industry that provides developers to integrate phone and sms features into products without having to know the inner workings of the telephone systems. However right now there is little if no standards and it’s still difficult to work with multiple providers of services. Hopefully the tools and systems I create will improve this.</p>
<p>2) The two primary features that I am looking for are the improved testing and debugging tools, that will help me write good solid code with minimal bugs and the access to the MSDN subscription so I can setup a virtual lab of different servers to be able to properly test that my programs run correctly on different platforms.</p>
<p>3) My blog is <a href="http://alanbarber.org/" rel="nofollow">http://alanbarber.org/</a>, I don’t post often but I’m very active in the technical community on twitter @alanbarber and attend many conferences and usergroups.</p>

1. I want to create some Indian Web Services (Social Bookmarking, Social Media, Q&amp;A etc services) in Indian Languages. This will help in connecting more indians with Internet. Therefore This subscription will help me to get VS2010 and Windows for development purpose.<br />
2. I just purchased an HP Workstation for development purpose. But The Windows disc I got with it is useless because it is a restore disk. That means it restores the computer in factory conditions by formatting entire HDD. This means my data will be always on risk. Therefore I need another copy of Windows.<br />
I also write articles about technology in hindi language in my blogs:<br />
