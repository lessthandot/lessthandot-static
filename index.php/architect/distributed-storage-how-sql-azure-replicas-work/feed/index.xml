		<description><![CDATA[I think this falls into an &quot;it is what it is&quot; bucket. The application has no awareness that whether the latency talking to the database is because we told it to talk to an Azure DB that has to wait on a quorum for writes or because we told it to write to a database over a noisy internet connection or if it&#039;s actually a DB installed down the hall on the PC under the CFO&#039;s desk. :)

The fabric tries to level load the primary nodes (which have higher performance impact since they handle both reads and writes) across the available db servers so you don&#039;t end up with one very busy serving a stack of primary replicas and two other servers lazily handling just secondaries with write traffic. 

One correction, the DB only needs 2/3 of the replicas (so the primary and one of the secondaries) to commit the write, so this also helps on both the resiliency and performance fronts.

MS also did a good amount of network architecture 2-3 years back to improve their horizontal communications. Prior to that they weer optimized for in-and-out traffic for services like hotmail that primarily served end users, the network re-architecture focused on reducing the hops/latency for communications between servers in the DC. This helped DB performance and communications with other storage services and APIs internally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As far as I know, this is built in with no option to turn it off. I have found SQL Azure performance to be less than I expect from dedicated systems, but the shift from the original two option (web/business) model to one where you can dial you per performance up and down a between a larger number of tiers now seems to make it less cut and dry.

You can turn on a premium database, scale it to their highest performance tier, flip a switch to turn on transparent encryption, flip another to geo-replicate to the other side of the country, delete a table and use the point-in-time restore to rewind five minutes in time, etc. with minimal effort. So I think the question shifts to a wider set of trade-offs then just a straight performance/$ one.

I&#039;m not trying to sell anyone on it, but I&#039;ve been the one maintaining backup policies, replications, and such in the past and it&#039;s nice to have an alternative other than &quot;we&#039;ll do it after we get these big projects out of the way&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eli, great explanation and great animation, I always find visual interpretations of technical articles easier to understand. Question; It seems this HA solution provide in Azure is very robust potentially at the expense of performance ie. it looks more like your typical high safety mirroring option. Do you know if there is an asynchronous high performance alternative offering for Azure whereby the use similar technology to commit to the replica&#039;s without waiting for the hardening acknowledgement to come back to the transaction ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My understanding is that regardless of replication options, you continue to have a 3 replica setup like this as a the base. For premium, the way they handle geo-replication to other datacenters is by seeding new secondary replicas in those datacenters that get an asynchronous feed of the changes (rather than participating the quorum like the secondaries above). So they get the same stream of changes the local secondary replics do, though there is some buffering in the middle in case of network issues.]]></description>
