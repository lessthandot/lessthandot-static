We used a separate build configuration for architecture validation that ran around 2am, mostly because we first tried using the tremendously slow visual studio tool and didn&#8217;t want each build taking 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The codebase in question was probably between half and three-quarters of a million lines split into 30+ projects.  I never saw an ad-hoc analysis take more than 2-2 1/2 minutes and this was running on our spare machines that were *very* underpowered.  I would expect it ran much faster than that on our build server, and that NDepend 4 would be at least incrementally faster than 3.</p>
