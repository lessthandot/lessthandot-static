		<description><![CDATA[My first impression is that what&#039;s built into VS2010 is not as advanced as NDepend.  You can get pretty good dependency diagrams, and this architecture validation feature is great (I wanted to jump for joy when I saw the way it worked with Team&#039;s &quot;Gated Check-Ins&quot;) but you don&#039;t get the same fine-grained control that NDepend gives you.  The lack of CQL is a big drawback form my perspective.  But we use TFS at work, and the integration there could be a massive plus.  I&#039;m really going to have to dig into this more deeply in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The flipside is its&#039; much easier to set up this kind of validation than with NDepend - I think the new tools will be much easier to digest for people who are unfamiliar with this kind of thing.  And I have little doubt that they will continue to improve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to kick the tires on the team integration without spending anyone&#039;s money, try out &lt;a href=&quot;/index.php/DesktopDev/MSTech/visual-studio-2010-beta-2-virtual-machin&quot;&gt;the VM images Denis wrote about earlier&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
