You can get pretty good dependency diagrams, and this architecture validation feature is great (I wanted to jump for joy when I saw the way it worked with Team&#8217;s &#8220;Gated Check-Ins&#8221;) but you don&#8217;t get the same fine-grained control that NDepend gives you.  The lack of CQL is a big drawback form my perspective.  But we use TFS at work, and the integration there could be a massive plus.  I&#8217;m really going to have to dig into this more deeply in the near future.</p>
<p>The flipside is its&#8217; much easier to set up this kind of validation than with NDepend &#8211; I think the new tools will be much easier to digest for people who are unfamiliar with this kind of thing.  And I have little doubt that they will continue to improve.</p>
<p>If you want to kick the tires on the team integration without spending anyone&#8217;s money, try out <a href="/index.php/DesktopDev/MSTech/visual-studio-2010-beta-2-virtual-machin">the VM images Denis wrote about earlier</a></p>
