<p>Isn&#8217;t there any tool that would generate all the necessary code? The common functionality could be hidden in base classes but some code needs to be written again and again, and that&#8217;s not quite &#8220;cool&#8221; ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having difficulty understanding why we would need a dynamic number of rows in the dialog when we are editing the equivalent of a record in the database with a given number of columns. Ignoring that, though, I believe what I would do in this situation is pass a an ordered key/value set to the view property that drives the dialog. That way the dialog can dynamically build the proper number of rows to edit my object. </p>
<p>The major difference between Passive View and MVC model->view communications is that in MVC the controller handles input from the user, but the view retrieves the data to display as output. In Passive View the same decision logic occurs, but handling the input and retrieving the output to display both happen in the Presenter. MVC&#8217;s view is smarter, but the view exposed in Passive View can easily be implemented by a number of interfaces (json, web service, test class) and a greater portion of the logic is now unit testable.</p>

<p>I have some issues to take up with the MVP pattern. MVP seems to be a valid architecture for only simple GUI interfaces.</p>
<p>The fact that the model is completely seperated from the view brings up some problems that seem impossible to solve without going back to MVC.</p>
<p>Consider : I have a table with X columns. I now want to build a component that is a dialog where I can edit the values in the table. In this dialog I want to have X rows (a label and text field), where I can perform editing, close it, then the table updates.</p>
<p>The problem is, the View needs to know about the model in order to generate the correct number of rows. There is no way to do this without the view knowing about the model.. we could create some intermediary &#8216;model-proxy&#8217;, but then we are really fluffing things up.</p>

Instead of having events like that button push handled locally, the event would be bound directly to a method in the presenter. The downside is that this makes the Presenter aware of the type of interface, since there are interface- or control-specific arguments passed to the Presenter which it not only needs to accept but also operate on. A more pure method would probably be to have events defined for the the view that are more generic, handle the UI or control events and turn them into those view events. But this sounds like more work.</p>
<p>I think in the end it&#8217;s up to the author to decide what fits their needs the best, whether they prefer to translate to view events, bind implementation-specific events directly to the presenter, or wire event handlers to a single call in the Presenter.</p>

I want the presentation logic to be uncaring and unaware of whether the model instance it is interacting with is a web service facade, a super-basic quick-and-dirty implementation like I actually used, a domain driven model, or a dummy class to return very controlled outputs for unit testing. Dependency injection using something like StructureMap or Windsor would be among the best solutions, a middle-of-the-road solution might be a handmade DI class to orchestrate creation of the right model(s) without the extra weight of a full framework.</p>
