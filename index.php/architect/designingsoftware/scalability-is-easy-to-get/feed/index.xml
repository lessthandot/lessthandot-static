		<description><![CDATA[Voodoo Child: Been there :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The whole reason I wrote a simulator for these scenarios was because having conversations about scaling tend to devolve into a lot of hand waving. I&#039;m going to do a couple more posts and post up the code so when people are in similar situations they can at least run some scenarios and make some pretty graphs in excel to bring to the conversation :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely, unfortunately that&#039;s not obvious to the people that skip the baseline. I&#039;ve seen a number of developers that had a tendency to make a logical leap from &quot;I code good&quot; to &quot;my code makes the system faster/better/strong/smarter&quot;, which made performing a baseline seem redundant and/or wasteful. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is doubly unfortunate, since my anecdotal experiences have shown a strong correlation between skipping the baseline and poor optimization.]]></description>
