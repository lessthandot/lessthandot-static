		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eli, first thank you for your time! 
Well, my tests where made on an i7 laptop with decent disk and on loopback interface, probably I would need to setup a cloud VM to do some further testing.
Actually I am working on a major refactoring, this system was born during the travels to meet my girlfriend mostly as a proof of concept so i&#039;m restructuring everything to unit test every needed part. But if you&#039;d like to take a look there is the demo repositiory on github (https://github.com/endaroza/Node.Cs.MusicStore) and the documentation (http://www.kendar.org/?p=/dotnet/nodecs).
Let me know :) PS Any suggestion, even creepy, is more than welcome!!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Enrico, I&#039;d love to take a look. Most of the tests above are more for comparison to one another than to another environment. That VM is basically running on a single core with the a database on a neighboring VM, both probably fighting over the same disk IO, etc. It&#039;s useful enough to see major behavior changes from run to run on the same &#039;hardware&#039;, but probably not something I would compare to another system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have just developed an application server similar to Owin but with the Node.Js &quot;thread free&quot; approach, and ported the MvcMusicStore to it (on Github&lt;/a&gt;). Actually i reached consistently from 350-400 requests/sec with JMeter on dynamic content. While searching for perf.test i&#039;ve seen your article and i would like to ask you what you think about it.
Kind regards,
Enrico]]></description>
