1) You could use Cosmos, but store all of the objects in a single collection (this will reduce the costs and only add a little overhead of keeping your different objects organized)<br />
2) If all of your lookups are by key, you could use blob storage and treat it as a key/value store (where the value would be your serialized document)<br />
3) SQL Azure has a Basic level that&#8217;s great for small projects and only runs $5/month<br />
4) Table storage is also an option I would consider looking at &#8211; you don&#8217;t see much about this any more, but it&#8217;s cheap and performs well</p>

Cosmos DB is not priced well for small projects that want to use multiple collections under the current pricing scheme. I definitely prefer the objects I&#8217;m currently interacting with (Users vs Authentication secrets) separate rather than having one belong to the other, but not to the tune of a whole new Collection monthly price. One idea I&#8217;ve been playing with is storing dissimilar objects in the same collection, potentially partitioning by type, and seeing if I run into any type of performance issues with that. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to use the unique constraint for users like I do now. </p>
<p>I could certainly see putting roles as a collection on the user and, technically, could do that with authentication secrets too (though I&#8217;ll likely lose performance for lookups when authenticating). But there is a limit to the number of collections I an squeeze everything down to that still makes this expensive for a smaller project. I really like the model of Cosmos DB, but what I&#8217;m starting to realize is that it just doesn&#8217;t make financial sense to use it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your good article. </p>
<p>We currently have some $$$ problem with CosmosDb on Azure. Each collection is around 30$ minimum per month.<br />
So it could be in our interest to use only one Collection to manage all the entities (User, Role, &#8230;).<br />
In your example, you only use User, but imagine if you have to use Role too, will you put them in the user collection too?</p>
