		<description><![CDATA[Great article, very helpful. It may help some to note that more recent versions of MySQL (5.6.4+ I think) now do support milliseconds. Change your date creation to Date(3) and MySQL will store the date as &#039;2015-01-01 13:45:30.258&#039;. It has to be when the table is created, you can&#039;t do it with ALTER TABLE...

We&#039;re already having success with log4net and MySQL separately.  Hadn&#039;t really had the cycles to try combining them yet...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t - as mentioned above this is not going to work with the latest version of PostSharp though, and I am not going to update because it is not free anymore.  I&#039;m fairly sure the approach with new version would be similar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you may be missing the point Saeed.  It seems like a lot of code (though not a lot more than it&#039;d take to get something you can explicitly call) but it saves you from writing even a single method call in places you need logging.  It also makes it easy to implement wholesale changes in your logging behavior without needing to change method signatures all over the place.  In large systems, this benefit is not trivial.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Alex,&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for such a grate example. I have implemented your code in my application and it works well, one thing though, it is taking much time to insert record in db as around 2-3 thousands records enter during login process and more for other events. Will you please tell me how can i make it faster. Actually  I m implementing it in MVC. My problem is i want to create a log of what actions are slowing us down for the whole site and let those events build up for 2-3 days.  Then group by action, and get an average time to process, and see what the major issues are in the application. Please help&lt;br /&gt;
 me on this&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrei, I haven&#039;t used log4postsharp, but it does look very promising.  If I need this again, I plan to use it (assuming I can get it running with PostSharp 1.5 / mono)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jon, sorry I didn&#039;t see this comment but I&#039;m not sure what could cause your problem with the base controller.  Take it you weren&#039;t overriding OnActionExecuting in your class ;)  If I get a chance I&#039;ll look into this.]]></description>
