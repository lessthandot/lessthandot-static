		<description><![CDATA[This post applies to both SQL code and the strange gobbldy gook languages developers play with (stuff like C#, VB etc).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am pretty sure I have got a whole shelf full of code that is ever evolving.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like building up a collection of libraries and utility classes that I can use/reuse in my C# coding (a habit I picked up from my C programming days) and I often develop something new, get to about 90% completion and then put it away for ages only to come back 6 months later and either go:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh cool, did I do that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
or&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OMG WTF, I better hide this before someone sees it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you said, it&#039;s all part of the learning process and why I love doing what I do..The day I stop having fun and learning something new is the day I take up knitting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had to do this myself several times in the past. I always got a kick out of rewriting and finetuning code that wasn&#039;t written by me. When it was *my* code though that I was asked to &quot;improve&quot; months after I had written it, there were voices in my head that literally wouldn&#039;t let myself hear the end of it. ;) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good post, thirster42, and good day indeed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Denis.  The main reasoning for updating the proc, to me, was the fact that the report that uses this proc is ran a lot each day, and reducing the footprint, even if it&#039;s just a little bit, is actually a pretty big change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome...good for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know, if I had to look at code and rewrite stuff I wrote a while back I would be rewriting for a year  :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do rewrite stuff if I see e performance benefit, for example we upgraded to SQL 2008 from 2000 and I now use the ranking functions for paging instead of the old ghetto subquery set rowcount method.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also now use dates instead of datetime for when I only need dates. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;
