		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having a little different issue.  When I call my stored procedure from VB6 using the ADODB Command object, the application is getting &quot;0&quot; for a return value regardless of what is in the Return Statement from the stored procedure.  I can&#039;t see anything different that I&#039;ve done in my code than in yours (other than the fact that I&#039;m using VB6).  I was able, however to get the return value from an output parameter in the stored procedure.  It&#039;s not a very attractive workaround, however, in my opinion.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t believe so - I believe that would require a second call to the procedure to store the recordset.  You do not have access to the return value until the recordset is closed, or if the recordset is never stored (in a variable) in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any reason you don&#039;t use the RecordCount property to check for the existence of a rowset instead of using the return value for this purpose? There should be relatively low overhead for checking this property to see if it is a non-zero figure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2 years later...&lt;br /&gt;
Since I use the retval to determine whether there IS a recordset, is there a way to reverse the process and read the return value first, then the recordset (without executing the command twice)?]]></description>
