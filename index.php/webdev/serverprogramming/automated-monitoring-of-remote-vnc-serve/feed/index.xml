		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never had a BSOD but I&#039;d imagine it&#039;d stop responding all together and fail at the initial connection attempt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A simpler solution came to me earlier: since I have access to the webserver I could monitor the access log and flag up a problem if one of the screens hasn&#039;t accessed anything in a while. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could even have a javascript/iframe &quot;pinging&quot; a specific page every 10 seconds so it&#039;s easier to check the log and quicker to flag up any problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, still a pretty neat technique which could come in handy for other applications!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, interesting post and idea! I like the idea of maybe comparing the pixels to the desktop colour but I guess it depends on exactly what/how it has crashed as to whether that would work or not. And what happens if you get a BSOD...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the welcome!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For anyone looking to use this for a similar purpose as me you could go further and use Image::Imlib2-&gt;query_pixel(0,0) and compare it to the desktop colour to test for browser crashes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe even use Image::Imlib2-&gt;load to open the previous screenshot then compare it to the new one to test for browser lockups.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#039;d then be able to setup email notifications for most faults.]]></description>
