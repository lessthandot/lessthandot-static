		<description><![CDATA[Yo, interesting stuff. I just tackled the exact same problem, but glancing at the way you solved this I&#039;m unsure if your equations generalize if:&lt;br /&gt;
1. right wheel going faster than left&lt;br /&gt;
2. both are going backwards&lt;br /&gt;
2b. where one goes goes faster than the other, then the other goes faster than the one&lt;br /&gt;
3. one is going backwards and the other going forwards&lt;br /&gt;
3b. where one goes goes faster than the other, then the other goes faster than the one]]></description>
