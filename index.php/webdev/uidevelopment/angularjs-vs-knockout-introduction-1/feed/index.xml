		<description><![CDATA[I started learning KO ages ago but I just don&#039;t like it, writing it just doesn&#039;t feel right to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Been doing quite a bit of Angular lately and the more I use it the more I like it. So far this series (only just finished reading the 3rd post) makes me feel like I made the right choice moving to Angular. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can&#039;t wait to read the rest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Garry: Thanks for the vote of confidence :) Another reason I approached this the way I did was because I&#039;m a little further down the learning track with Knockout, so by aiming at capabilities I not only learned how to do things in AngularJS, I also had to go deeper with Knockout, then in many cases had to go back and go deeper with AngularJS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alex.G: I used the default router all the ay through for AngularJS, it was able to handle the simple cases well enough and provide a backdrop to compare routing libraries against. I&#039;ll take a look at the two you mentioned and see if I can get a handle on it well enough to try out. I suppose if I am using external routers for knockout, I probably should show that you can do the same with AngularJS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a nice router for angular (the default one sucks) here: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router&lt;br /&gt;
And Ember&#039;s router is also pretty nice I think. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, I found that all the standalone routers were not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
May I shamelessly mention my own router:  https://github.com/AlexGalays/abyssa-js&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s stateful and can play with knockout very well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, should be a good series. I have developed a couple of systems using Knockout and found it to be very easy to use. Not had much experience with Angular so far, but it seems to have more capabilities. Depends if you want an all encompassing framework which could cause trouble in the future if it needs tweeking for your needs or mix and match different frameworks. Knockout does include templating as well though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree, but there are already a number of posts out there that attempt to compare them despite solving different problems (binding framework vs SPA framework). Many compare the two directly, pointing out all of the functionality AngilarJS has that knockout doesn&#039;t. Some then mention you can use Durandel or add extra scripts to fill the gaps. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought the comparison could be done better, by showing how to provide those capabilities to a knockout example that makes it comparable to AngularJS. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I expected this to turn into an AngularJS vs Durandel post, because so many posts had made it sound complicated or complex to add scripts to have similar behavior with knockout, but I managed to get through the whole set of examples without once pulling in Durandel and only just realized that it is still in the list above and I have no working examples using it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, yeah, knockout vs AngularJS isn&#039;t a one-to-one comparison, but I think knockout + packages vs AngularJS certainly is and it certainly helped me understand that the boogie man of &quot;you have to add more packages&quot; is not as bad as people want us to believe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oops, spoilers.]]></description>
