		<description><![CDATA[I also haven&#039;t mentioned VB.Net, C#, JScript, and a few others :) I&#039;ve used Python as a scripting language in ASP and the only other options I know of is CGI, there isn&#039;t really a dedicated &quot;Python on the web&quot; type of technology (that I am aware of). If we go down the CGI path then technically anything becomes a web development language, which is possibly true but reduces the effect of the 2 and 4 language requirement up above, as well as the &quot;web dev is not app dev&quot; digression :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edit: Ok, I&#039;ve done a little searching and it looks like python usage for the web is wider spread than the I originally thought, so I&#039;ve added it to the list above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Eli, I thought I was a developer but it is obvious that I still have the brains of a 5 year old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would say, personally I can tick of most of the things in each section so that gives me a vote of confidence and also it&#039;s handy you have produced that as I can see what gaps I have and focus on those (something we tend not to do as we get stuck into our roles).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would say, as a &quot;Developer&quot; the other things like Communication, Sense of Humour, Documentation, Analysis skills are a given.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adios!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the positive comments everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom: Glad you liked it. Just keep in mind that not every job requires the most experienced person you can possibly find, sometimes finding someone who is at the beginner level (or a beginner web dev and advanced in something else) can have a lot of benefit also. I only mention it because I&#039;ve see over-hiring have some negative consequences too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Claude: I find myself in a gray area on the rewrite issue. On the one hand I think the most important part is that someone understands what rewriting is and how it works, once you know that then picking up the mechanics of how to do it in IIS7 vs Apache vs ASP.Net MVC vs ASP.Net WebPages...I couldn&#039;t figure out how much depth I would expect. &lt;br /&gt;
As far as REST vs WS, not all SOAP is WS- and SOAP still has a larger use base than REST, but I would consider putting REST in the list as an &quot;A&quot; also.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erik: Good additions. I found it hard to find a place to draw the line. I&#039;ve added your entries.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cookie hacking and cookie hijacking would seem super important intermediate security concepts. Not understanding these would pretty much be disqualifiers:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Trusting the user ID in a cookie lets anyone savvy enough to modify the cookie log in as someone else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Not understanding cookie hijacking is less crucial but still opens a gigantic security hole big enough to drive a bus through. When cookies are successfully stolen they allow someone to log in as someone else. If any security-sensitive identifeirs are put in the cookies, at the very minimum ensuring the cookie comes from the same hostname it was registered on seems important.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. This is definitely a good list to use as an interviewer or job seeker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One point of disagreement is that using IIS 7&#039;s wizard to create rewrite rules is more of a disqualifier. Ideally, a candidate can show proficiency with Apache mod_rewrite and regex. Most of the time those rules can be used as-is with an IIS plugin like Ionic&#039;s ISAPI Rewrite Filter (IIRF).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would also add the ability to understand and build restful interfaces, which are more common today than WS-*, the ability to write jQuery plugins and advanced concepts like the module pattern, closures and namespacing in JavaScript.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article! I sent this to my manager for our next round of hiring. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few years ago (at another company) I was on the hiring team for a web developer and I was made fun of for wanting to ask the candidate if they knew the difference between a GET and a POST. So I didn&#039;t. And guess what? We ended up firing the guy we hired after just a few months!]]></description>
