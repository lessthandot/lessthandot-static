		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve looked at it in the past. It&#039;s definitely a handy way to hook JavaScript tests into the VisualStudio environment. I believe I tried it out on my sqlishard.com project and wired into it the TeamCity build too. When I was using it this way, I still had to kick off all my tests manually when I made changes, so it didn&#039;t buy me much over using a SpecRunner.html file in a browser. 

I&#039;m not sure I would consider this to be closer to NCrunch. NCrunch runs my .Net build and tests continuously as it detects me making changes in the workspace, showing a visual indicator in the bottom right of build failures, test failures or every ok. The test runner that shows details has a better display than the Visual Studio one, showing the full hierarchy and making it easy to re-run, debug, ignore or add in  tests, etc. But that&#039;s just the beginning, on top of all of that it shows coverage indicators in the Visual Studio window for the tests it has run, highlights longer-running lines by altering the color of the coverage dot, and allows me to right-click any dot and immediately run a test in debug mode to break at that line. Exceptions are displayed as X&#039;s and show their detail in a mouseover, so I can explore the exact stack of calls the exception traversed without re-running the test even once.


Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like Chutzpah, the differences are really down to what the Visual Studio test runner provides vs NCrunch&#039;s more extensive capabilities. It also hasn&#039;t annoyed me to the same level keeping karma&#039;s dependencies stable has.]]></description>
