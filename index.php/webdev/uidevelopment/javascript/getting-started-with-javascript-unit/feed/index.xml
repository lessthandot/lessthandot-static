		<description><![CDATA[Another one that someone sent me this week (I haven&#039;t tried it myself yet) is Testling: http://www.catonmat.net/blog/announcing-testling/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This one is a remote test server that will run tests across a variety of platforms. Obviously this adds some extra dependencies and time to your testing, but it adds the ability to easily test multi-platform.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still pretty new to node.js and hadn&#039;t heard of the assert class. Although now that you&#039;ve mentioned it, it seems kind of obvious that node.js would be a good platform for headless js testing since all you need is the binary. Hmm, I may have a new project for this weekend, thanks :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked them about the same, for different reasons/purposes. jsTestDriver&#039;s downsides were the reliance on Java and the fact that it still required a browser, but the ability to test against multiple browsers was also a positive. What bothered me about Qunit was the need to switch screens to see the results and the fact that the display of the tests seems to get unwieldy when used for larger numbers of tests (to the point where I considered going in and customizing the layout to fit a larger set more easily or simply hiding passed tests and showing a count).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s not to say I disliked either, I just found those points to be a little clumsy. Someone also pointed me to Jasmine (http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) which, though it&#039;s behavior-driven, may fill in some of the gaps in between these two, I&#039;ll have to see. Also been planning on looking more into sql unit testing, not sure which will happen first. I still haven&#039;t gotten around to doing write-ups on Selenium yet, and I had planned on doing at least 2 on that. The backlog overfloweth.]]></description>
