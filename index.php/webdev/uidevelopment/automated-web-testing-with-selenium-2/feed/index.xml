		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I am keep interested to learn to design &#038; develop Hybrid framework which is in c# &#038; includes concepts like Page object model + NUnit + Data Driven. So, if you have any such framework with code which help me to refer while developing mine. If you have any such then pls share with us.

		<description><![CDATA[Eli, I am a QA working for a company that only manually tests. I am new to automation with no prior knowledge or training in test engineering. I am anxious to bring automation into our product but really don&#039;t know where to start. Our VP of Development has seen what I am wanting to introduce and wants me to pursue automation with Selenium, SpecFlow and Gherkin. I am willing to do this as I have a passion for QA and for learning but I really need some advice on where to start. After learning the Selenium IDE, I am now in the process of learning how to work with the Selenium WebDriver and exported Selenium IDE tests in C#. Any help you can give me would be great. I have been looking at YouTube videos, Pluralsight and the web for help but there are just so many different opinions out there about the subject. Can you recommend any books, videos, blogs or courses I should start with?

Thanks,
D Ben]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
This is a nice post for framework understanding from the scratch.
Can you provide online training on framework creation.....I have lots of doubts and need toc lear those as I am assiging a new project on selenium.
Please tell....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I assume you mean the POST API calls return HTML, kind of like how a bank payment or paypal interaction works (otherwise if there were XML/JSON/etc I would use HttpClient or something similar). In that case, I think I&#039;m ok with using some sample forms to start the process. In fact, I would publish those sample forms as documentation or examples of how to use your API. Then you not only have automation tests on your codebase, but also on the sample forms you offer people as a starting point. you could also use them as reference materials if you need to add new functionality, ensuring the old samples and a new set continue to run against the API.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article, thanks!

I&#039;m using FluentAutomation but I do not see how to perform a POST test (I have an API that has some post-only methods).

Any suggestions on this issue? I currently have forms setup to help with this but it seems like a terrible hack.

Thanks!
