		<description><![CDATA[Nice article! It&#039;s good to see how Angular does the routing in code for someone never used it.
I just open-sourced a mini SPA framework that I put together with Knockout being the core component:

knockout-spa
https://github.com/onlyurei/knockout-spa
A mini (but full-fledged) SPA framework built on top of Knockout, Require, Director, jQuery, Sugar that powers RentEver.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[kpolo: I admit I&#039;m not crazy about it either, but I got used to the syntax as I went. I felt the same way about RequireJS when I started looking at it, and that at least has them as separate arguments in the define/require calls. I&#039;m sure they spent some time thinking abut this before they went down that path, so it will be interesting if they (AngularJS contributors) find a new direction as the project contiues to grow or if this remains the method going forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
pagerjs user: I took a look at pagerjs, it&#039;s different from the libraries I looked at in that it is basically doing what I did with the dynamic templates, but using id&#039;s to define the routes. I haven&#039;t used it, but I feel like trying to build something large and manage a lot of routes with this model would be a bit ungainly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the kind of stuff in Angular/Javascript that is nuts:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
sampleApp.config([&#039;$routeProvider&#039;, function (routeProvider) {&lt;br /&gt;
    ...&lt;br /&gt;
);&lt;br /&gt;
}]);&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the config method takes in an array of strings and functions? This is a cognitive debt for the developer. There is nothing intuitive about it. There is a difference between a framework that works for you (e.g. Spring) and a framework that you work for (Angular!). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Angular matures, in a few years, you will look at this code and be dumbfounded.]]></description>
