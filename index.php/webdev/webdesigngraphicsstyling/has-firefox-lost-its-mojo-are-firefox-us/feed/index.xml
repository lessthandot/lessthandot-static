		<description><![CDATA[I dumped FF in favour of Chrome as I found FF to be such a hog (both on win and lin). Chrome is much better mainly by the fact that each tab is effectively it&#039;s own isolated process, meaning one bad plugin generally can&#039;t cripple the whole browser (I say that, but it happened to me just yesterday, but definitely not as much as I&#039;ve seen in FF)&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[No, the script blocking is built into the browser.  But it&#039;s not fine-grained enough.  Once you allow a certain domain, any request generated from a page on that domain is allowed (as opposed to the NoScript approach where you need to allow each SOURCE domain).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Host files are nice, but I still prefer to specify what I trust instead of what I don&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;This doesn&#039;t make up for its&#039; crippled script-blocking which seems to be designed more for maximizing google&#039;s ad revenue than actually protecting users&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Isn&#039;t that just a 3rd party extension or are you now allowed to create a noscript extension on Chrome?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway I also use this host file to block certain bad sites  http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm]]></description>
