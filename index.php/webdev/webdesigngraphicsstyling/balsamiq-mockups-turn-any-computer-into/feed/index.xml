		<description><![CDATA[Great post, I love Balsamiq! Use it every week. &lt;br /&gt;
Before I use Balsamiq though, I like using MockUpMagnets.com. &lt;br /&gt;
Great for client meetings, UI brainstorming, etc.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice. I usually just sketch it out on a piece of paper, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for Comic Sans, its developer said, &quot;If you love it, you don&#039;t know much about typography. But, if you hate it, you really don&#039;t know much about typography, either, and you should get another hobby.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Peldi - I guess I should have RTFM before I wrote about it (I probably would have if it bothered me, but I like it as is :) ).  Thanks for the link to the FAQ though - it doesn&#039;t seem like it would be too hard to change at all, and a much better alternative than using the system font!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took a look at the chalkboard font, and it looks pretty good to me (not that much different from Comic Sans to be honest - but I guess that is why I am not a font designer!)  I like that you&#039;re shooting for a hand written font that&#039;s a little rough around the edges, as that style really fits the feel of the mockups well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
tperri - I&#039;ll be starting a Comic Sans support group soon, your invitation is in the mail :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Alex, thanks so much for the great review!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On OSX we no longer use Comis Sans as default, but for those who are on Windows/Linux and want to change font, we have a FAQ for you: http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups/support#comicsans&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again for taking the time to write this up, we appreciate it!]]></description>
