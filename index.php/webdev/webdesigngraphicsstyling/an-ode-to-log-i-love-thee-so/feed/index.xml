Where would you store the config info? You wouldn&#039;t store it clientside..so your options are on the server or in the database]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of our security is run through Active Directory. So even if someone were to compromise the database, they would still have to know which AD group to inject (if even there is an AD group with the security that they want). And out DBA is pretty rock solid on keeping things locked down. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But like all in-house dev teams we have to weigh the costs, risks, and the benefits. Sure, we could likely make the system more secured. But at this point, any intrusion would have to be made from someone acting inside the network on the domain with an auditable connection to the database. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No software solution is uncrackable. It is always just a matter of time and desire to break through any digital lock. Similar to a fire door or a secured safe, they are rated in the amount of time that the can resist assault. So we develop our software with the goal of being able to dissuade most low-medium risks. Anything more than that and our development costs rise with out the company &quot;selling more cheese powder&quot; as my boss likes to say. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So find a happy medium. In our case, the security we have has held up against all would be assaults so far, and we have a tried and true recovery plan for the servers and data. While the centralized maintenance has allowed us to detect and correct configuration errors and even alter production functionality with out deployments. &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m starting to get a little leery of the idea of storing all config data in a database (referencing the EP).  a good hacker only needs to hack one source for the entire solution and then fwap!  offline you go.  while it&#039;s an interesting and useful idea to create a repository of metadeta, do you really want to store items like connection strings and (dare I say) user info (see DotNetNuke et al)? I fear it&#039;s potential lethality to some gimboid coder that doesn&#039;t know how to configure database security properly on a production system.  fwap!  OLUG!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be happy to debate the value of a differing technology :) I&#039;m inclined to stick to my findings, but if anyone out there can change my opinion, I will jump sides immediately. I will gladly argue for what I believe to be right till the sun goes down, and if through that debate my understanding of what is right changes, then I will gladly argue that till the sun goes down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although, most of the stuff I&#039;ve posted about so far has been dealing with concepts and ideas. Whether you are writing in Silverlight, Flash, ASP.Net, Java, PHP, C#, Pascal, ADA or even Lisp, the concepts of integrated logging and configuration still hold true. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But even that is up for debate ;)&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Rick, don&#039;t worry about it..when you give people anonymous voting capabilities there will always be a person who will vote 1 because it is not a technology he/she uses. If it is a MySQL dev and you talk about SQL Server you will get a 1 ..If you are a rails guy a Django person might vote 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think it is more a disapproval of the technology than your writing]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow a rating of 1? Sure, it wasn&#039;t my best writing ever but really, a 1? At least leave some feed back. Let me know what it is that has disappointed you so. Maybe you know something that I can improve on or learn from.  Feel free to share.&lt;br /&gt;
