		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got a few more SL based blog entries to write. I have 2 Silverlight 3 applications currently running in production environments, and a 3rd major system in development now and another SL/SharePoint system in early discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far I have to say, Silverlight it a huge step up for developing in over the ASP.Net/AJAX/Javascript/JQuery/CSS stack. The only downside is the platform limitations. &lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[That was quick!  You should write more about your experiences w/ Silverlight.  I dabble now and then but never for anything serious.  But I think in a few months me and Silverlight might be ready to take that next step in our relationship, it&#039;d be good to be prepared.]]></description>
