		<description><![CDATA[I have noticed this as well on the analytics of one of our more important websites. Firefox is consistently losing market share to Chrome (and to Safari).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I think that Firefox is becoming less and less stable - and the days where it was remotely possible for someone to get infected with a virus through firefox are long gone. Chrome does a much better job and does not use the 1 GB of RAM that Firefox allocates to itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am still using Firefox but it won&#039;t be for long...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find that current firefox 10 is MUCH better than chrome at managing memory. I currently have 32 tabs open in firefox, which has been running for 3 days and it&#039;s only taking ~700M of RAM. In contrast, chrome would regularly leak(?) memory and balloon up to ~3G of RAM.]]></description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Checked my site&#039;s analytic data and Chrome took over as #1 in June and end up #1 for year. FF is third.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I switched from FF to Chrome after it chewed up 1GB of RAM several times. Chrome wasn&#039;t much better. Both of these programs leak memory very badly. 500MB to keep 3 tabs open? Seriously?? Switched back to FF, because I just like it better. Restarting every so often to clear the memory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently converted to chrome for development work (their development tools are much better than firebug + others IMO), but I can&#039;t bring myself to use it for normal browsing.

		<description><![CDATA[I like Firefox, the interface I prefer - how it can be customised, the status bar (after putting it back with Status4eva addon.) Didn&#039;t like how Firefox copied Chrome with the floating status on link hover - flicking on and off at bottom of screen, too distracting, and a blatant copy without actually improving anything. With no option to switch back, really bad move by Firefox.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I won&#039;t go Chrome for same reason and not enough options in Chrome - and no option not to upgrade. I think the trend to slim down the browser interface so there&#039;s not much showing anymore is not the best thing, especially when it&#039;s forced on you without option to have it your way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Court: Chrome does track quite a bit of what many people (rightly) consider private info.  And then there&#039;s Google&#039;s position of not doing things... until they do.  Chrome is a bad &#039;foot in the door&#039; toward losing a lot of your privacy.  All so an advertising company can make money off selling your data to 3rd parties.  NO THANKS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a front-end developer and recently canned Mozilla as my browser of choice. It just become so buggy, freezes, and crashes a lot more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I first switched, I thought Chrome wouldn&#039;t have a lot of the plugin-ins and extensions I had with FireFox. That simply wasn&#039;t the case. All the tools were available, and Chrome&#039;s own built in dev tools are very similar to Firebug. You just have to get used to using it - it&#039;s similar but operates a little differently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a few months, I&#039;m a lot more comfortable with Chrome and have all but forgotten about FireFox. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within my group of about 10 or so developer friends, I was last holdout to switch over to Chrome. Most had already given up when they switched to FireFox 4.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you are so against the &#039;privacy infringements&#039;, may I suggest the open-source Chromium project: http://www.chromium.org/&lt;br /&gt;
As for the article:&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;A lot of people still use FireFox because of the fact that some extensions don&#039;t exist on Chrome&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;
What complete and utter bullshit. I would guestimate the percentage of users who stick with Firefox for this reason is in the extreme minority. Chrome is faster, leaner, generally better and is being advertised to the public at large. That is why it&#039;s market share is increasing.]]></description>
