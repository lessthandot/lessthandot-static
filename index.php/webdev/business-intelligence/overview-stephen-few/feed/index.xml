		<description><![CDATA[@Cody: I have read both editions of Information Dashboard Design. The 2nd edition is more of an update on the first edition with a bit more attentention to mobile devices. Does it warrant a new edition? I don&#039;t know. I do know that there wasn&#039;t a second edition because of mistakes, because I didn&#039;t discover any &quot;corrections&quot;.

Well, at least there was new stuff in the book. The Expert Cube development book (about SSAS from publisher Packt) has got a new edition, and the only thing Packt did was change  2008 everywhere to 2012. Seems more of a rip-off to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve sworn off the guy on principle. After buying the first editions of Now You See It and Show Me The Numbers and having him come out with a second edition of the latter so quickly, I felt like I was being used as a beta tester. 

I feel like if there are errors or changes in the book those should be provided online. Why do I have to go out and repurchase expensive hardbacks when the author realises he made a mistake the first time?

I know the publishing world doesn&#039;t follow my principles of fairness (especially with each new edition on technical topics coming out largely untouched and unedited with a new version number) but I also choose not to support it in this case because it&#039;s about design rather than technology. I won&#039;t be suckered by Mr Few again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By far the seminal books of this area of analytics and BI. I also agree how amazing the gap can sometimes be between product feature suggestions (by folks like Kimball/Few) and actual vendor implementation of these requested features. I remember when Kimball suggested the OLAP extensions to SQL. It took some DBMS vendors a decade to implement these OLAP extensions. The same is true with Few&#039;s suggestions in the area of data visualization.]]></description>
