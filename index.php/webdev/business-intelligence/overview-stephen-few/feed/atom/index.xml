The 2nd edition is more of an update on the first edition with a bit more attentention to mobile devices. Does it warrant a new edition? I don&#8217;t know. I do know that there wasn&#8217;t a second edition because of mistakes, because I didn&#8217;t discover any &#8220;corrections&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, at least there was new stuff in the book. The Expert Cube development book (about SSAS from publisher Packt) has got a new edition, and the only thing Packt did was change  2008 everywhere to 2012. Seems more of a rip-off to me.</p>

After buying the first editions of Now You See It and Show Me The Numbers and having him come out with a second edition of the latter so quickly, I felt like I was being used as a beta tester. </p>
<p>I feel like if there are errors or changes in the book those should be provided online. Why do I have to go out and repurchase expensive hardbacks when the author realises he made a mistake the first time?</p>
<p>I know the publishing world doesn&#8217;t follow my principles of fairness (especially with each new edition on technical topics coming out largely untouched and unedited with a new version number) but I also choose not to support it in this case because it&#8217;s about design rather than technology. I won&#8217;t be suckered by Mr Few again.</p>

I also agree how amazing the gap can sometimes be between product feature suggestions (by folks like Kimball/Few) and actual vendor implementation of these requested features. I remember when Kimball suggested the OLAP extensions to SQL. It took some DBMS vendors a decade to implement these OLAP extensions. The same is true with Few&#8217;s suggestions in the area of data visualization.</p>
