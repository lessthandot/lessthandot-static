		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment ZHernandez.  I agree with you completely !  My initial goal was to learn Analysis Services.  But then I had to brush up on SSIS and Reporting Services just to take the exam.  Ironically, at the time I took the exam, I was strongest in SSRS as I had set up a report server and was well practiced in creating reports, but the material covered on the test was very different.  Keep studying and good luck !&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will soon take this exam. I am using the MS Training Kit and the practive test offered. It does seem to be really tough, and some topics are not covered. My complain is that this MCTS certification should have been split into two or three exams, especially the SSAS part which is really bulky (with topics like MDX, Partitions, Data Mining).]]></description>
