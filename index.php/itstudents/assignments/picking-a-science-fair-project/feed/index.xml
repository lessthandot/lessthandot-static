		<description><![CDATA[You are right. You can not just go into a science project immediately without considering any factors. Science projects should be sensible enough too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I just love this article!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shame we don&#039;t have something similar in the UK (at least not in the &#039;common&#039; schools for &#039;common&#039; people).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I intend to introduce my son to my geek toys, and finally answer his question: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WTF does dad do in the garage every evening?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Son, I am building a time machine&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I think it&#039;s great, UK kids are lacking in so many things, not because there is a lack of academic content but because everything has become so PC that people are simply too afraid to let their kids be, well, kids!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am a tinkerer at heart I am always playing around with some new electronic gadget that I can incorporate into my PC or my car (total nerd!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this information George, I remember having to go through this with my 6 year old son and it took me a couple of days just to decide what to pick (of course he also changed his mind a gazillion times). We purchased The Everything Kids&#039; Science Experiments Book and then narrowed it down from there&lt;br /&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Great post and I&#039;m looking forward to others in the series!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I totally agree that the project idea is the most important decision.  My school did the science fair for 6th graders, and much like your daughter, we had to come up with our projects, which could be basically about anything.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it came time for my brother (3 years younger) to do his science fair, they had changed it from &quot;do anything that interests you&quot; to &quot;build a bridge out of pasta (and don&#039;t use lasagna).&quot;  How lame!  I think the teachers were just lazy and heaven forbid we have some independent thought and/or creativity in school!]]></description>
