I try not to assume that not meeting that bar is a result of them being a &quot;bad apple&quot; because it could also just as easily be due to misplaced enthusiasm about their own skill level or because they are actually fairly senior but felt that a simple technical problem required a full enterprise architecture or, the opposite, didn&#039;t require a readable answer.]]></description>
